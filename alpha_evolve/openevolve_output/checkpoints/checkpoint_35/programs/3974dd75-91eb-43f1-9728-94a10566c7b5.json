The current implementation has a few issues:\n\n1. The `tau` function uses `p=1.5` in its signature but `update_rho` passes `p=2.0` to it, which might cause inconsistencies.\n2. The update triggers are very simple: only when one residual is more than 2 times the other, which might not be responsive enough.\n3. Compared to the top performer (score 0.0829), which has more nuanced adjustments when residuals are balanced, this program lacks those adjustments.\n\nLet's analyze the top performer:\n- It starts updates earlier (K0=3 vs K0=5)\n- It has balanced adjustments when residuals are not imbalanced by factor mu\n- It uses thresholds 0.5 and 0.05 for average residual to make small adjustments\n\nHowever, we want to maintain some diversity while improving fitness. Let's try to incorporate some elements from the top performer while keeping our approach distinct.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n1. First, fix the inconsistency in `tau` by making sure the parameters are consistent.\n2. Add balanced adjustments when residuals are not imbalanced by factor mu, but with different thresholds than the top performer to maintain diversity.\n3. Adjust K0 to start updates earlier, but not as early as the top performer (K0=4 for diversity).\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=1.5, K0=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates earlier with smaller steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        # Small step size for early iterations\n        return c / ((k + 1.0) ** p) * 0.1\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=4):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates earlier for faster adaptation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change makes `tau` consistent with the top performer's approach (no updates before K0) and uses K0=4 for diversity. Also, we set p=2.0 to match the standard.\n\nNow, let's update `update_rho` to include balanced adjustments:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Intentionally conservative C1-safe ADMM update.\n\n    Slower than standard because updates are triggered\n    only under *extreme* residual imbalance.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Balanced trigger: use relative imbalance without absolute condition\n    # Adjust mu to be slightly smaller for more responsiveness\n    if r_norm > 2.0 * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n\n    if s_norm > 2.0 * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n\n    return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.5,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    More responsive than before but still maintains some conservatism.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Trigger updates for significant imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        # Use thresholds that are different from top performer for diversity\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        if avg_residual > 0.8:  # Large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/2), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.02:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/2), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes:\n1. Set mu=2.5 (between 2.0 and 3.0) for a balance between responsiveness and conservatism\n2. Add balanced adjustments with thresholds 0.8 and 0.02, which are different from the top performer's 0.5 and 0.05\n3. Use t/2 for adjustments, which is more aggressive than t/3 in the top performer but less than full t\n4. The docstring is updated to reflect the new approach\n\nThis should make the algorithm more responsive while maintaining diversity in the feature space. The fitness score should improve because:\n- It now makes adjustments in more situations (not just extreme imbalances)\n- The thresholds are chosen to be different from the top performer to explore a different region of the solution space\n- Starting updates earlier (K0=4) should help with faster adaptation\n\nLet's hope this improves the fitness score towards or above 0.0829."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
