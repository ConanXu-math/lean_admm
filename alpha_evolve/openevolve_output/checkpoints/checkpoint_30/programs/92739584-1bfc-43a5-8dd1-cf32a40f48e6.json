The current implementation is simpler than the top performers, but may be too conservative. The top performer (score 0.0829) has a more nuanced approach: it adjusts rho even when residuals are balanced, based on their magnitude, with thresholds at 0.5 and 0.05. This seems to help convergence.\n\nThe current program only updates when one residual dominates by a factor of mu (with a minimum threshold), and otherwise keeps rho unchanged. This might miss opportunities to adjust rho when both residuals are large or small, which could slow convergence.\n\nLet's analyze:\n1. The top performer uses K0=3 (earlier updates) vs current K0=5\n2. The top performer uses p=2.0 vs current p=1.5\n3. The top performer has additional logic in the balanced case\n4. The current program's tau function has a min() which might not be standard\n\nLet's make changes to incorporate the successful elements from the top performer while keeping some diversity:\n\n1. Change K0 from 5 to 3 to start updates earlier\n2. Change p from 1.5 to 2.0 for standard decay\n3. Remove the min() in tau to use standard formula\n4. Add balanced adjustment logic with thresholds similar to top performer, but with slight variation for diversity\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=1.5, K0=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size with earlier start and slower decay.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    # Ensure step size doesn't become too small too quickly\n    return min(c, c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p))\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=3):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates even earlier for faster adaptation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=1.5,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Balanced ADMM update: more responsive than before but still stable.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n    \n    # More responsive triggers: only require relative dominance\n    # But add a minimum threshold to avoid updates when residuals are very small\n    min_threshold = 1e-6\n    \n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps) and r_norm > min_threshold:\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    \n    if s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps) and s_norm > min_threshold:\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    \n    return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    Simpler trigger conditions for more responsive updates.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Simple trigger: respond to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        # Use thresholds that are slightly different from the top performer for diversity\n        if avg_residual > 0.6:  # Slightly higher threshold than top performer's 0.5\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/4), t, \"inc\"  # Smaller adjustment than top performer's t/3\n        elif avg_residual < 0.04:  # Slightly lower threshold than top performer's 0.05\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/4), t, \"dec\"  # Smaller adjustment\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes should:\n1. Start updates earlier (K0=3 vs 5) which helped the top performer\n2. Use standard step size decay (p=2.0) without the min() which might have been limiting adjustments\n3. Add balanced adjustment logic with thresholds that are slightly different from the top performer to maintain diversity while potentially improving performance\n4. The adjustment factors (t/4) are smaller than the top performer's (t/3), which might provide more stability while still helping convergence\n\nThe removal of the minimum threshold in the imbalance condition aligns with the top performer's approach, which seems to work better. The balanced adjustments should help guide rho more effectively when residuals are neither too large nor too small.\n\nThis approach combines elements from the best performer with slight variations to explore a different point in the feature space while aiming to improve fitness."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
