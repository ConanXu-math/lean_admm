K0=5 in tau, which delays updates until iteration 5, while top performers use K0=3 for earlier updates.\n2. p=1.5 in update_rho's tau call, but p=2.0 in the tau function itself? Wait, the tau function uses p=2.0, but update_rho passes p=1.5 to tau? Actually, tau is called with p from update_rho, which is 1.5.\n3. Thresholds for balanced adjustments are different: avg_residual > 1.0 and < 0.1, while top performers use around 0.5-0.7 and 0.04-0.08.\n\nThe top performers seem to have more aggressive updates with earlier starts and more sensitive thresholds. Let's adjust these to be closer to the best performers while maintaining some diversity.\n\nAlso, note that the current program's tau function has K0=5, which might be too conservative. Let's change it to K0=3 for earlier updates.\n\nLet's make the following changes:\n\n1. Change K0 from 5 to 3 in tau function\n2. Adjust the thresholds in the balanced section to be more sensitive\n3. Ensure consistency in p parameter\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=3):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates earlier for faster adaptation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=1.5,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Trigger updates for significant imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        if avg_residual > 1.0:  # Large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/2), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.1:  # Small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/2), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    Earlier updates and moderate thresholds for better convergence.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Less conservative trigger to respond more quickly to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        # Use thresholds that are slightly different from top performer for diversity\n        if avg_residual > 0.65:  # Moderate to large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/3), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.06:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/3), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes should bring the program closer to the top performers while maintaining some diversity:\n1. K0=3 allows updates to start earlier, which seems beneficial based on top performers.\n2. The thresholds 0.65 and 0.06 are between the values used in the diverse programs (0.6-0.7 and 0.04-0.08), offering a balanced approach.\n3. Changed p to 2.0 to match the tau function's default and top performers.\n4. Added more descriptive docstrings similar to top performers.\n\nThis should improve the fitness score while keeping the code length reasonable."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
