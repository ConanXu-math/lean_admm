The current approach uses a ratio-based adjustment to the step size, which seems effective. However, I can see opportunities to refine the update logic to potentially achieve better convergence or efficiency.\n\nOne observation is that the adjustment to `t` is always increasing it by up to 50% when the residual ratio is large. But perhaps we can make the update more nuanced by considering the magnitude of the residuals themselves, not just their ratio. Also, the current approach uses the same factor for both multiplication and division, which might not be optimal.\n\nLet's try a different approach: adjust the step size based on both the ratio and the current iteration `k`. Since `t` decreases with `k`, we might want to be more aggressive in early iterations and more conservative later.\n\nHere's a modified version that:\n1. Uses a different scaling function that depends on both ratio and iteration\n2. Adjusts the update factor differently for multiplication and division\n3. Ensures the auxiliary scalar remains C1-safe\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Compute imbalance ratio (always >= 1)\n    if r_norm > eps and s_norm > eps:\n        ratio = max(r_norm / s_norm, s_norm / r_norm)\n    else:\n        ratio = 1.0\n    \n    # Adjust step size based on ratio, but keep it bounded\n    scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.5)\n    adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.5 * scale)  # Increase t by up to 50% when ratio is large\n    \n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n\n    # Auxiliary scalar: include information about adjustment (C1-safe as it's based on t)\n    aux = adjusted_t\n=======\n    # Compute imbalance ratio (always >= 1)\n    if r_norm > eps and s_norm > eps:\n        ratio = max(r_norm / s_norm, s_norm / r_norm)\n    else:\n        ratio = 1.0\n    \n    # Adjust step size based on ratio and iteration number\n    # Early iterations can be more aggressive, later ones more conservative\n    # The weight decays with k\n    weight = 1.0 / (1.0 + 0.1 * k)  # Decaying weight\n    scale = min(ratio / mu, 2.0) * weight\n    adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + scale)\n    \n    # Different factors for multiplication and division\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        # When primal residual is larger, increase rho more aggressively\n        factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t * (1.0 + 0.2 * min(ratio, 3.0))\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n        aux = adjusted_t * (1.0 + 0.2 * min(ratio, 3.0))\n\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        # When dual residual is larger, decrease rho more cautiously\n        factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t * (1.0 - 0.1 * min(ratio, 2.0))\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n        aux = adjusted_t * (1.0 - 0.1 * min(ratio, 2.0))\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n        aux = adjusted_t\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change introduces several new ideas:\n1. The adjustment now considers the iteration number `k` through a decaying weight, making updates more aggressive early on and more conservative later.\n2. The scale is now bounded by 2.0 instead of 1.5, allowing for larger adjustments when appropriate.\n3. Different update factors are used for multiplication and division, which might better handle the asymmetry in the updates.\n4. The auxiliary scalar now reflects the specific factor used, providing more information.\n\nHowever, I'm concerned that this might violate C1-safety because the auxiliary scalar now depends on residuals through `ratio` in a more complex way. Let's adjust to ensure it remains C1-safe by making sure `aux` is based on `t` and bounded constants.\n\nActually, looking more carefully, `aux` now includes terms that depend on `ratio`, which depends on residuals. This might not be C1-safe. Let's revise to keep `aux` independent of residuals.\n\nWait, the original program had `aux = adjusted_t`, which depends on `ratio` through `scale`. So it already depends on residuals. So my change is consistent with that.\n\nBut to be safer, let's make sure `aux` is always based on `t` and bounded constants. Since `ratio` is bounded by our scaling, it should be fine.\n\nThis approach adds diversity to the feature space by introducing iteration-dependent weighting and asymmetric update factors, which might lead to better performance. Let's see if it improves the fitness score."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
