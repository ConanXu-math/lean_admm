The top-performing programs all have a score of 0.0829, so we should aim to match or exceed that. The current program has several differences:\n\n1. `tau` uses `K0=10` which delays updates until iteration 10, while top performers use `K0=3` for earlier adaptation.\n2. The update logic is more complex with additional conditions that may be causing issues.\n3. The top performers have a simpler structure with balanced adjustments based on average residual thresholds.\n\nThe current program's additional condition (`if max(r_norm, s_norm) > 1e-4 and abs(r_norm - s_norm) < 0.5 * min(r_norm, s_norm)`) might be interfering with convergence. Let's simplify towards the proven successful pattern while maintaining some diversity.\n\nKey observations from top performers:\n- Use `K0=3` in `tau`\n- Use `mu=2.0`\n- In the balanced case, adjust based on average residual with thresholds around 0.5-0.7 for large and 0.04-0.05 for small residuals\n- Use `t/3` for adjustments\n\nLet's modify the current program to be closer to the best performers while keeping some unique elements for diversity.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=10):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=3):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates earlier for faster adaptation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,  # Reduced from 3.0 to be more responsive\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Balanced ADMM update: more responsive than before but still stable.\n    Updates are triggered when one residual significantly dominates the other.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # More sensitive trigger: only require relative dominance\n    # But add a small absolute threshold to avoid updates when both are tiny\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps) and r_norm > 1e-8:\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n\n    if s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps) and s_norm > 1e-8:\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n\n    # Additional condition: if both residuals are large, adjust rho to potentially speed up convergence\n    # This adds diversity to the approach\n    if max(r_norm, s_norm) > 1e-4 and abs(r_norm - s_norm) < 0.5 * min(r_norm, s_norm):\n        # If r_norm is slightly larger, increase rho, else decrease\n        if r_norm > s_norm:\n            return rho * (1.0 + 0.5 * t), t, \"bal_mul\"\n        else:\n            return rho / (1.0 + 0.5 * t), t, \"bal_div\"\n\n    # If neither condition is met, keep rho unchanged\n    return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    Simpler trigger conditions for more responsive updates, similar to top performers.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Simple trigger: respond to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        # Use thresholds that are slightly different for diversity\n        # Choose values between the best performers: 0.6 and 0.04\n        if avg_residual > 0.6:  # Moderate to large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/3), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.04:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/3), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes bring the program closer to the successful pattern seen in the top performers while maintaining some diversity through the specific threshold choices (0.6 and 0.04).
