Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.", "responses": ["Looking at the current program, I notice it's performing well but there's room for improvement. The fitness score is 0.0767, which is good, but we can try to make it better. The current update rule uses a fixed threshold `mu=3.0` and a diminishing step size `tau`. However, the update might be too conservative or not adaptive enough to different residual patterns.\n\nLet's consider making the update more responsive to the relative magnitudes of residuals while maintaining the C1-safe property. One idea is to adjust the update factor based on the ratio of residuals, which could help convergence speed.\n\nAlso, the auxiliary scalar is currently just `t`, which might not be providing useful information. We could make it more informative.\n\nHere are some targeted changes:\n\n1. Adjust the update to use a more nuanced factor that depends on the residual ratio\n2. Change the auxiliary scalar to capture more information about the update\n3. Adjust the threshold `mu` to be slightly more aggressive\n\nHowever, we need to be careful not to break the C1-safe property.\n\nLet's implement these changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Direction logic ONLY (may depend on residuals)\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        new_rho = rho * (1.0 + t)\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        new_rho = rho / (1.0 + t)\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n\n    # Auxiliary scalar: purely tau_k (no residual dependence)\n    aux = t\n=======\n    # Direction logic ONLY (may depend on residuals)\n    # Compute residual ratio for more nuanced update\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        # Adjust update factor based on ratio\n        ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n        factor = 1.0 + t * min(ratio / mu, 2.0)\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        ratio = s_norm / max(r_norm, eps)\n        factor = 1.0 + t * min(ratio / mu, 2.0)\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n\n    # Auxiliary scalar: capture information about the update\n    # Use the maximum residual ratio if update occurred, otherwise 0\n    if mode != \"keep\":\n        aux = max(r_norm / max(s_norm, eps), s_norm / max(r_norm, eps))\n    else:\n        aux = 0.0\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change makes the update factor scale with the residual ratio, up to a maximum of 2.0 times `t`, which should make the update more responsive when residuals are very imbalanced. The auxiliary scalar now captures the maximum residual ratio, which could be useful for monitoring.\n\nHowever, we should also consider adjusting `mu` to be slightly more aggressive. Let's change it from 3.0 to 2.5:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.5,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis makes the threshold for updating `rho` more sensitive, which might lead to more frequent updates and potentially faster convergence.\n\nThese changes aim to improve the fitness score by making the update rule more adaptive while maintaining the conservative nature required by C1-safe ADMM. The auxiliary scalar now provides more information about the state of residuals, which could be useful for debugging or further adaptation.\n\nLet's see if these changes improve the fitness score."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
