The top program uses a more dynamic approach with ratio-based adjustments and smaller, more frequent updates. The current program is very conservative with updates only under extreme conditions, which might be too slow to adapt.\n\nKey differences:\n1. The top program uses a dynamic `effective_mu` that changes with iteration, making it more responsive early on.\n2. It also includes small adjustments even when residuals aren't extremely imbalanced.\n3. The `tau` function in the top program allows updates even before K0, which might help early convergence.\n\nHowever, the current program has a different `tau` function (p=2.0, K0=10) which is more conservative. Let's try to incorporate some elements from the top program while maintaining some diversity.\n\nLet's make the following changes:\n1. Modify `tau` to allow small updates even before K0, but keep p=2.0 for diversity.\n2. Change the update logic to use a ratio-based approach with dynamic mu, but keep mu=3.0 to be different from the top program's mu=2.0.\n3. Add small adjustments when residuals aren't extremely imbalanced.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=10):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=10):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Allow small updates even early on.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        # Small step size for early iterations\n        return c / ((K0 + 1.0) ** p) * 0.5\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Intentionally conservative C1-safe ADMM update.\n\n    Slower than standard because updates are triggered\n    only under *extreme* residual imbalance.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Extremely conservative trigger:\n    # require both relative AND absolute dominance\n    if (\n        r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps)\n        and r_norm > (mu ** 2) * eps\n    ):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n\n    if (\n        s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps)\n        and s_norm > (mu ** 2) * eps\n    ):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n\n    return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Balanced C1-safe ADMM update with dynamic adjustments.\n    More responsive than extremely conservative approach.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Use ratio-based adjustment with dynamic mu\n    ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    # Adjust mu to be dynamic based on iteration\n    effective_mu = mu * (1.0 + 1.0 / (k + 1.0))\n    \n    if ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Increase rho when primal residual is larger\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif 1.0 / ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Decrease rho when dual residual is larger\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # Small adjustment based on which residual is larger\n        if r_norm > s_norm:\n            return rho * (1.0 + 0.3 * t), t, \"small_mul\"\n        elif s_norm > r_norm:\n            return rho / (1.0 + 0.3 * t), t, \"small_div\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExplanation:\n1. The `tau` function now allows small updates even when k < K0, which should help early iterations without being too aggressive. The scaling factor 0.5 is chosen to be moderate.\n2. The update logic is changed to use a ratio-based approach with dynamic `effective_mu` that decreases over time (since mu is multiplied by (1 + 1/(k+1)) which approaches mu as k increases). This makes the algorithm more responsive early on.\n3. Added small adjustments (with factor 0.3 instead of 0.5 to be different from the top program) when residuals aren't extremely imbalanced, which should help fine-tune rho.\n4. Removed the absolute condition (r_norm > (mu**2)*eps) which was too restrictive.\n\nThese changes should make the algorithm more adaptive while keeping some unique characteristics (mu=3.0, p=2.0, K0=10, and small adjustment factor 0.3) to maintain diversity in the feature space. This might improve the fitness score by allowing better convergence in fewer iterations."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
