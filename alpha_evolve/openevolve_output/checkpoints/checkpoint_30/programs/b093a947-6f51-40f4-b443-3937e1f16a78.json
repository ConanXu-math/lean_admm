Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.", "responses": ["Looking at the current program, I notice that the fitness score has declined from 0.0828 to 0.0768. The top-performing programs all have a score of 0.0828, so we should aim to get back to that level. The current program introduces several modifications that may be too aggressive or complex, which could be hurting performance.\n\nKey differences in the current program:\n1. Modified `tau` function to have faster initial decay by adding `0.1 * np.sqrt(k + 1.0)` to the denominator.\n2. Introduced a dynamic `mu` that changes with iteration `k`.\n3. Uses `np.log(ratio)` to scale the step size, which can be unstable.\n4. The auxiliary scalar `aux` is just `t`, while in top programs it's `adjusted_t` which includes information about the adjustment.\n\nThe top programs are simpler and more conservative:\n1. They use a standard `tau` function without extra terms.\n2. They use a fixed `mu`.\n3. They adjust `t` based on the ratio of residuals, but in a bounded way (using `min(ratio / mu, 1.5)` and then `adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.5 * scale)`).\n4. They return `aux = adjusted_t`.\n\nThus, to improve fitness, we should revert to a simpler, more conservative approach similar to the top programs. However, to maintain diversity, we can keep some unique elements while ensuring they don't harm performance.\n\nLet's make the following changes:\n\n1. Revert `tau` to the standard form used in top programs.\n2. Use a fixed `mu` instead of dynamic.\n3. Use the bounded scaling approach for adjusting `t`.\n4. Ensure `aux` includes adjustment information.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=1.0, p=1.2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Diminishing step size sequence with faster initial decay.\n\n    Requirements:\n    - tau_k >= 0\n    - summable for p > 1\n    - depends only on k and fixed constants\n    \"\"\"\n    # Add a small constant to denominator to prevent division by zero\n    # This gives faster decay initially\n    return c / ((k + 1.0 + 0.1 * np.sqrt(k + 1.0)) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=1.0, p=1.2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Diminishing step size sequence.\n\n    Requirements:\n    - tau_k >= 0\n    - summable for p > 1\n    - depends only on k and fixed constants\n    \"\"\"\n    return c / ((k + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe adaptive ADMM penalty update rule with dynamic threshold.\n\n    The threshold adapts over iterations to be more responsive early on.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Summable step size (independent of residuals)\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    \n    # Dynamic threshold that diminishes with iterations\n    # This makes the algorithm more sensitive early, and more stable later\n    dynamic_mu = mu * (1.0 + 2.0/(k + 1.0))\n    \n    # Direction logic with dynamic threshold\n    if r_norm > dynamic_mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        # More aggressive update when residuals are very imbalanced\n        # Use a larger step when the ratio is high\n        ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n        # Scale step size by log(ratio) but clip to avoid extreme values\n        scale = min(max(np.log(ratio), 0.1), 2.0)\n        new_rho = rho * (1.0 + t * scale)\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > dynamic_mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        ratio = s_norm / max(r_norm, eps)\n        scale = min(max(np.log(ratio), 0.1), 2.0)\n        new_rho = rho / (1.0 + t * scale)\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n\n    # Auxiliary scalar: purely tau_k (no residual dependence)\n    aux = t\n\n    return new_rho, aux, mode\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe adaptive ADMM penalty update rule.\n\n    Conservative by design.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Summable step size (independent of residuals)\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n\n    # Compute imbalance ratio\n    if r_norm > eps and s_norm > eps:\n        ratio = max(r_norm / s_norm, s_norm / r_norm)\n    else:\n        ratio = 1.0\n    \n    # Adjust step size based on ratio, but keep it bounded\n    # Use a moderate scaling: min(ratio / mu, 1.5) to prevent excessive updates\n    scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.5)\n    adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.5 * scale)  # Increase t by up to 50% when ratio is large\n    \n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        # Use adjusted step size for update\n        factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n\n    # Auxiliary scalar: include information about adjustment\n    aux = adjusted_t\n\n    return new_rho, aux, mode\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes bring the program back to a simpler, more conservative design that matches the top performers. The key improvements are:\n1. Removing the dynamic `mu` which may cause instability.\n2. Replacing the `log(ratio)` scaling with a bounded linear scaling, which is more stable.\n3. Ensuring the auxiliary scalar includes adjustment information, which may be important for convergence tracking.\n\nThis should help improve the fitness score back towards 0.0828 while keeping the code concise (under 500 characters)."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
