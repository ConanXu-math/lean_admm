Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.", "responses": ["Looking at the current program, I notice it's very similar to the top performers but with slight variations in parameters. The fitness score has declined slightly from 0.0829 to 0.0828, which suggests that recent changes may have introduced a minor inefficiency.\n\nKey observations:\n1. The current program uses `scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.5)` and `adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.5 * scale)`\n2. Top performers use `scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.4)` and `adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.4 * scale)`\n3. The current program's parameters (1.5 and 0.5) may be too aggressive, leading to larger adjustments that could destabilize convergence in some cases.\n\nTo improve fitness, I should consider making the update more conservative while maintaining diversity. Let's look at the diverse programs for inspiration:\n- Program D1 uses `scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.6)` and `adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.4 * scale)`\n- This suggests that bounding the scale at 1.6 with a 0.4 multiplier might work well.\n\nHowever, since the current program's fitness declined, I should try to find a balance between the top performers and diverse approaches. Let's try a more nuanced approach that adjusts the step size based on iteration number to be more responsive early and conservative later.\n\nHere's a plan:\n1. Make the adjustment factor depend on iteration k to be more adaptive\n2. Keep the overall structure similar to top performers for stability\n3. Ensure the changes are C1-safe (tau_k is summable)\n\nLet's implement a version where the scaling factor decreases with iterations, making updates more conservative over time.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Adjust step size based on ratio, but keep it bounded\n    # Use a moderate scaling: min(ratio / mu, 1.5) to prevent excessive updates\n    scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.5)\n    adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.5 * scale)  # Increase t by up to 50% when ratio is large\n=======\n    # Adjust step size based on ratio and iteration, but keep it bounded\n    # Early iterations can be more responsive, later ones more conservative\n    # The maximum scale decreases with iterations\n    max_scale = 1.6 / (1.0 + 0.1 * k)  # Starts at 1.6, decreases slowly\n    scale = min(ratio / mu, max_scale)\n    # The multiplier also decreases with iterations\n    multiplier = 0.5 / (1.0 + 0.05 * k)  # Starts at 0.5, decreases\n    adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + multiplier * scale)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change introduces iteration-dependent scaling, which should help balance responsiveness early on with stability later. The parameters (1.6, 0.1, 0.5, 0.05) are chosen to be similar to diverse programs while adding time-dependent behavior.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that the auxiliary scalar `aux = adjusted_t` remains C1-safe. Since `adjusted_t` is based on `t` (which is summable) multiplied by bounded factors, it should still be summable.\n\nLet's also consider adjusting the threshold `mu` to be slightly different from the standard 3.0 to add diversity. But since the top performers all use mu=3.0, I'll keep it as is for now.\n\nWait, the current program's docstring mentions \"dynamic threshold\" but doesn't actually implement it. Let's make the threshold adaptive based on iteration to match the docstring:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        # Use adjusted step size for update\n        factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n=======\n    # Slightly adjust mu based on iteration to be more responsive early\n    adjusted_mu = mu * (1.0 + 0.2 / (k + 2.0))  # Starts slightly higher, approaches mu\n    if r_norm > adjusted_mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        # Use adjusted step size for update\n        factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > adjusted_mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis makes the threshold start at 3.0 * (1.0 + 0.2/2) = 3.3 and approach 3.0 over time, which should make the algorithm more conservative early when residuals might be large, and then relax to the standard threshold.\n\nThese changes should improve fitness by making the update rule more adaptive to the iteration number, which could lead to better convergence behavior. The approach is different from top performers (adding time-dependent scaling) while maintaining the core structure that has proven successful.\n\nLet's summarize the key improvements:\n1. Time-dependent maximum scale and multiplier for more nuanced adjustments\n2. Adaptive threshold that changes with iterations to match the docstring's promise\n3. Maintains C1-safety by ensuring all time-dependent factors are bounded\n\nThese changes should potentially improve convergence speed or stability, leading to a better fitness score while adding diversity to the population."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
