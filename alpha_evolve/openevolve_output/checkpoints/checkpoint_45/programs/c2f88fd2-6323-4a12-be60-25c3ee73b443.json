Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.", "responses": ["Looking at the current program and the evolution history, I notice that the top performers (Program 1 and 2) have a combined_score of 0.0829, while the current program has 0.0828. The differences are subtle, but I can see that the top performers use a slightly different approach to scaling the adjusted step size.\n\nSpecifically, in the top performers:\n1. They use `scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.4)` instead of `1.5`\n2. They use `adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.4 * scale)` instead of `0.5 * scale`\n3. They have a comment about increasing t by up to 56% when ratio is large, which matches 1.4 * 0.4 = 0.56\n\nIn the current program:\n1. scale is bounded to 1.5\n2. adjusted_t uses 0.5 * scale, which gives up to 75% increase (1.5 * 0.5 = 0.75)\n3. This might be too aggressive, leading to slightly worse performance\n\nAlso, the top performers have a more conservative approach, which seems to yield better results. Let's adjust the current program to match the parameters of the top performers while keeping the structure similar.\n\nAdditionally, I notice that the current program's comment says \"Increase t by up to 75% when ratio is large\" which doesn't match the actual calculation (1.5 * 0.5 = 0.75, which is 75%). But the top performers have 56%, which is more conservative.\n\nLet's make the following changes:\n1. Change the scale bound from 1.5 to 1.4\n2. Change the multiplier from 0.5 to 0.4\n3. Update the comment to be accurate\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Adjust step size based on ratio, but keep it bounded\n    # Use a moderate scaling: min(ratio / mu, 1.5) to prevent excessive updates\n    scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.5)\n    adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.5 * scale)  # Increase t by up to 75% when ratio is large\n=======\n    # Adjust step size based on ratio, but keep it bounded\n    # Use a moderate scaling: min(ratio / mu, 1.4) to prevent excessive updates\n    scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.4)\n    adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.4 * scale)  # Increase t by up to 56% when ratio is large\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nHowever, looking more carefully at the top performers, I see they also use `factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t` and then multiply or divide by factor, which is exactly what the current program does. So the only differences are in the numbers.\n\nWait, in the current program, the condition checks use `mu * max(s_norm, eps)` which is correct. But in the update, it uses `new_rho = rho * (1.0 + adjusted_t)` which is the same as `rho * factor` where factor is `1.0 + adjusted_t`. So that's consistent.\n\nActually, Program 1 and 2 use `factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t` and then `new_rho = rho * factor`, which is the same as the current program. So the only differences are in the scaling parameters.\n\nLet's also note that the top performers have a slightly different structure in the if-elif blocks, but that shouldn't affect functionality.\n\nTo further improve, I could also consider adding a small tweak inspired by the diverse programs. For example, some programs use different approaches to compute the ratio or handle edge cases. But since the top performers are very similar to the current program, I'll stick to adjusting the parameters.\n\nAnother observation: The top performers have `aux = adjusted_t`, which is the same as the current program. So no change needed there.\n\nThus, by making the parameters match the top performers, we should see an improvement in fitness score.\n\nLet's implement the changes exactly as in the top performer Program 1."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
