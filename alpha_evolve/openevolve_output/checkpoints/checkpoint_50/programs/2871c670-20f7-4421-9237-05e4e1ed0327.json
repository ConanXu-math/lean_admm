However, there's room for improvement by exploring different approaches that might yield better performance. The current program uses fixed thresholds (0.65 and 0.06) for average residual adjustments. Let's try to make the update more dynamic and responsive to the iteration number, which could help in achieving faster convergence or better stability.\n\nInspiration 3 shows an interesting approach with dynamic thresholds that change with iteration number. However, its fitness is slightly lower (0.0828). Let's try a balanced approach: keep the core structure but adjust the thresholds in a way that might improve performance.\n\nI'll modify the update_rho function to use thresholds that adapt based on the iteration number, but in a more moderate way than Inspiration 3. Also, I'll adjust the adjustment factor to be more aggressive when residuals are far from balance.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    Earlier updates and moderate thresholds for better convergence.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Less conservative trigger to respond more quickly to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        # Use thresholds that are slightly different from top performer for diversity\n        if avg_residual > 0.65:  # Moderate to large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/3), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.06:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/3), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with dynamic thresholds based on iteration.\n    Adjusts more aggressively in early iterations and becomes conservative later.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Dynamic mu adjustment: be more sensitive in early iterations\n    # This helps to correct imbalances quickly at the start\n    dynamic_mu = mu * (1.0 + 0.5 * np.exp(-0.1 * k))\n    \n    # Trigger updates for imbalances with dynamic threshold\n    if r_norm > dynamic_mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > dynamic_mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        \n        # Dynamic thresholds that change with iteration\n        # Early iterations: allow larger residuals, later iterations: tighten\n        high_threshold = 0.7 * (1.0 - 0.3 * np.tanh(0.1 * k))  # Decreases from 0.7 to ~0.49\n        low_threshold = 0.06 * (1.0 + 0.5 * np.tanh(0.1 * k))  # Increases from 0.06 to ~0.09\n        \n        # Adjust adjustment factor based on iteration\n        # Use larger adjustments in early iterations, smaller later\n        adjustment_factor = 3.0 + 2.0 * np.exp(-0.2 * k)  # Decreases from 5.0 to 3.0\n        \n        if avg_residual > high_threshold:\n            # Increase rho when residuals are large\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/adjustment_factor), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < low_threshold:\n            # Decrease rho when residuals are very small\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/adjustment_factor), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change introduces several dynamic elements:\n1. A dynamic mu that starts slightly higher and decays to the base mu, making the imbalance trigger more sensitive in early iterations.\n2. Dynamic thresholds for average residual that change with iteration number: the high threshold decreases and the low threshold increases over time, which helps to tighten convergence as iterations progress.\n3. A dynamic adjustment factor that starts larger (more aggressive adjustments) and becomes smaller (more conservative) over time.\n\nThese changes aim to improve convergence by being more responsive in early iterations and more precise in later iterations, which could potentially improve the fitness score. The use of np.tanh and np.exp ensures smooth transitions.\n\nNote: This approach is different from existing programs, adding diversity in the feature space while potentially improving performance."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
