The fitness score is 0.0691, which seems to be a combined score where lower might be better? But the history shows \"Improvement in all metrics\" with this approach.\n\nHowever, the system values diversity across complexity and diversity dimensions. The current approach is very simple and conservative. Let's explore a slightly different approach that might improve convergence speed while maintaining stability.\n\nOne idea is to make the update triggers more responsive by adjusting the conditions. Currently, it requires both relative AND absolute dominance, which is very strict. We can try to make it more balanced while still being safe.\n\nAlso, the `tau` function always returns 0 for k < K0, which might delay adaptation. Perhaps we can make it non-zero earlier but smaller.\n\nLet's propose two changes:\n1. Adjust `tau` to be non-zero from the beginning but with a smaller step size\n2. Modify the update conditions to be less strict by removing the absolute condition and adjusting the relative threshold\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=10):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=1.5, K0=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates earlier with smaller steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        # Small step size for early iterations\n        return c / ((k + 1.0) ** p) * 0.1\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Extremely conservative trigger:\n    # require both relative AND absolute dominance\n    if (\n        r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps)\n        and r_norm > (mu ** 2) * eps\n    ):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n\n    if (\n        s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps)\n        and s_norm > (mu ** 2) * eps\n    ):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n\n    return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\n    # Balanced trigger: use relative imbalance without absolute condition\n    # Adjust mu to be slightly smaller for more responsiveness\n    if r_norm > 2.0 * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n\n    if s_norm > 2.0 * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n\n    return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExplanation:\n1. The `tau` function now starts with non-zero values from the beginning, allowing earlier adjustments but with very small steps (scaled by 0.1). This might help the algorithm adapt sooner without being too aggressive.\n2. The update conditions are simplified to only check relative imbalance (with a threshold of 2.0 instead of 3.0), which should make updates more frequent and potentially improve convergence speed.\n3. By removing the absolute condition, we allow updates even when residuals are small, which might be beneficial.\n\nThese changes aim to make the update strategy more responsive while still being safe, potentially leading to faster convergence and better fitness score. The reduced threshold (mu from 3.0 to 2.0) and earlier updates might help balance the primal and dual residuals more effectively.\n\nThis approach is different from the current one in terms of complexity (slightly more complex `tau` function) and diversity (different update strategy), which aligns with the system's goals."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
