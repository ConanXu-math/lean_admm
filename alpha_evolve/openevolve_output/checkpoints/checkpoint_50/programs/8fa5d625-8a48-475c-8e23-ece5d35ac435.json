To potentially improve fitness, I should consider making the update strategy more responsive while maintaining stability.\n\nOne observation: the top performers use different adjustment factors (t/2.5, t/3) and thresholds. The current program uses t/3 for both increase and decrease, which is similar to some top performers. However, the thresholds might be suboptimal.\n\nLet's analyze:\n1. Program 1 uses thresholds 0.7 and 0.03 with adjustment factor t/2.5\n2. Program 2 uses thresholds 0.65 and 0.03 with adjustment factor t/3\n3. Program 3 uses thresholds 0.65 and 0.06 with adjustment factor t/3\n\nThe current program uses 0.6 and 0.04. Perhaps adjusting these thresholds could lead to better performance. Also, note that the adjustment factor t/3 might be too conservative compared to t/2.5.\n\nAnother idea: the tau function could be modified to be more aggressive in early iterations to speed up convergence. Currently, K0=3, which delays updates until iteration 3. Some inspiration programs use different p values (1.5) or different K0 values.\n\nLet's try two changes:\n1. Make the adjustment factor slightly more aggressive (t/2.5 instead of t/3) to match the best performer\n2. Adjust thresholds to be between the best performers: 0.65 and 0.03\n3. Also, make tau more responsive by using p=1.5 (as in Program D1) which decays slower, allowing larger steps for longer\n\nHowever, we need to be careful not to break the C1-safe property. The tau function should remain diminishing.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=3):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates even earlier for faster adaptation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=1.5, K0=3):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates even earlier for faster adaptation with slower decay.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Simple trigger: respond to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        # Use thresholds that are slightly different for diversity\n        if avg_residual > 0.6:  # Moderate to large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/3), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.04:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/3), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\n    # Simple trigger: respond to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        # Use thresholds and adjustment factor inspired by top performers\n        if avg_residual > 0.65:  # Moderate to large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/2.5), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.03:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/2.5), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes aim to:\n1. Make tau decay slower (p=1.5 instead of 2.0) which keeps step sizes larger for more iterations, potentially helping convergence\n2. Adjust thresholds to 0.65 and 0.03 which are used by multiple top performers\n3. Use adjustment factor t/2.5 which is more aggressive than t/3, matching the best performer\n\nThis combination should make the algorithm more responsive while maintaining stability, potentially improving the fitness score. The changes also introduce diversity by using p=1.5 which is different from most top performers (which use p=2.0), but was seen in Program D1 which had good performance."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
