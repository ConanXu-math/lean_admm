The fitness score is slightly lower (0.0828 vs 0.0829), which suggests these thresholds might be less optimal. However, to maintain diversity while improving fitness, I should consider adjusting these thresholds while keeping the overall structure.\n\nThe top performers use thresholds around 0.5-0.7 for large residuals and 0.03-0.05 for small residuals. The current program uses 0.8 and 0.08, which are more conservative. This might cause fewer adjustments, potentially slowing convergence.\n\nHowever, the adjustment factor is also different: t/4 vs t/3 or t/2.5 in top performers. A smaller adjustment (t/4) might be too conservative. Let's look at the best performers:\n- Program 1 uses t/2.5 with thresholds 0.7 and 0.03\n- Program 2 uses t/3 with thresholds 0.7 and 0.04\n- Program 3 uses t/3 with thresholds 0.5 and 0.05\n\nSo there's a trade-off: larger thresholds (0.8) with smaller adjustments (t/4) might not be responsive enough. Let's try to find a balance that maintains diversity while improving fitness.\n\nI'll adjust the thresholds to be closer to the middle range of top performers, but with a unique twist to maintain diversity. Let's try thresholds of 0.65 and 0.045 with adjustment factor t/2.8, which is between t/2.5 and t/3.\n\nThis should be more responsive than the current settings while still being distinct from existing programs.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Use thresholds that are different from the top performer for diversity\n        if avg_residual > 0.8:  # Moderate to large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/4), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.08:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/4), t, \"dec\"\n=======\n        # Use thresholds that balance responsiveness and stability\n        if avg_residual > 0.65:  # Moderate to large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/2.8), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.045:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/2.8), t, \"dec\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nAdditionally, I notice that the tau function in the current program uses p=2.0, which is the same as most top performers. However, Program 2 uses p=1.5 in its tau function, which makes the step size diminish more slowly. This could be an interesting point of diversity. Let's change p to 1.8, which is between 1.5 and 2.0, to see if it helps.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=3):\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=1.8, K0=3):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change should make the step size diminish slightly slower than p=2.0 but faster than p=1.5, potentially offering a good balance for adaptation.\n\nThese changes maintain the overall structure while adjusting parameters to potentially improve convergence. The new thresholds (0.65 and 0.045) are in the range of successful programs but not identical to any of them, preserving diversity. The adjustment factor t/2.8 is also unique. The p=1.8 in tau is a moderate change that might help with adaptation.\n\nLet's see if these adjustments can improve the fitness score from 0.0828 to at least 0.0829."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
