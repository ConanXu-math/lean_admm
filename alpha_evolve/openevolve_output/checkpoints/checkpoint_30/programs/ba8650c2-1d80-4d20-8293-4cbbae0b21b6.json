The top performer (Program 1) has a score of 0.0768, which is slightly better. The key differences are:\n\n1. The top performer uses a dynamic threshold `mu` that changes with iteration `k`\n2. It uses a modified `tau` function with faster initial decay\n3. It scales the update factor using `log(ratio)` with clipping\n4. The auxiliary scalar is simply `t` (tau) without residual dependence\n\nThe current program uses a fixed `mu=2.5` (instead of 3.0), and the auxiliary scalar depends on residuals when an update occurs. This might be less stable.\n\nLet's try to incorporate elements from the top performer while keeping some unique aspects for diversity. Specifically:\n1. Use dynamic threshold like in Program 1\n2. Use log scaling for the update factor\n3. Keep auxiliary scalar simple (just `t`)\n4. Adjust `mu` back to 3.0 (the default in top performers)\n\nHowever, note that the current program has `mu=2.5`, which might be more sensitive. Let's try a hybrid approach: use dynamic threshold but with a different base `mu` (2.5) for diversity.\n\nAlso, the `tau` function in the top performer has faster initial decay, which might help convergence.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=1.0, p=1.2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Diminishing step size sequence.\n\n    Requirements:\n    - tau_k >= 0\n    - summable for p > 1\n    - depends only on k and fixed constants\n    \"\"\"\n    return c / ((k + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=1.0, p=1.2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Diminishing step size sequence with faster initial decay.\n\n    Requirements:\n    - tau_k >= 0\n    - summable for p > 1\n    - depends only on k and fixed constants\n    \"\"\"\n    # Add a small constant to denominator to prevent division by zero\n    # This gives faster decay initially\n    return c / ((k + 1.0 + 0.1 * np.sqrt(k + 1.0)) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.5,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe adaptive ADMM penalty update rule.\n\n    Conservative by design.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Summable step size (independent of residuals)\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n\n    # Direction logic ONLY (may depend on residuals)\n    # Compute residual ratio for more nuanced update\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        # Adjust update factor based on ratio\n        ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n        factor = 1.0 + t * min(ratio / mu, 2.0)\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        ratio = s_norm / max(r_norm, eps)\n        factor = 1.0 + t * min(ratio / mu, 2.0)\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n\n    # Auxiliary scalar: capture information about the update\n    # Use the maximum residual ratio if update occurred, otherwise 0\n    if mode != \"keep\":\n        aux = max(r_norm / max(s_norm, eps), s_norm / max(r_norm, eps))\n    else:\n        aux = 0.0\n\n    return new_rho, aux, mode\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.5,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe adaptive ADMM penalty update rule with dynamic threshold.\n\n    The threshold adapts over iterations to be more responsive early on.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Summable step size (independent of residuals)\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    \n    # Dynamic threshold that diminishes with iterations\n    # This makes the algorithm more sensitive early, and more stable later\n    dynamic_mu = mu * (1.0 + 2.0/(k + 1.0))\n    \n    # Direction logic with dynamic threshold\n    if r_norm > dynamic_mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        # More aggressive update when residuals are very imbalanced\n        # Use a larger step when the ratio is high\n        ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n        # Scale step size by log(ratio) but clip to avoid extreme values\n        scale = min(max(np.log(ratio), 0.1), 2.0)\n        new_rho = rho * (1.0 + t * scale)\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > dynamic_mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        ratio = s_norm / max(r_norm, eps)\n        scale = min(max(np.log(ratio), 0.1), 2.0)\n        new_rho = rho / (1.0 + t * scale)\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n\n    # Auxiliary scalar: purely tau_k (no residual dependence)\n    aux = t\n\n    return new_rho, aux, mode\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes incorporate the successful elements from the top performer while maintaining a different base `mu=2.5` for diversity.
