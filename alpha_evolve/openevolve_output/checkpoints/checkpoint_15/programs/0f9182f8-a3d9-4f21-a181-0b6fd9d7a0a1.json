However, the system values diversity in features, and the current program has been marked as having \"No feature coordinates\" and \"code length exceeds 500 characters\". \n\nThe current program uses an adaptive mu that decreases with iterations, which is a feature not present in the simplest top performer (Program 1). To explore a different approach while maintaining or potentially improving fitness, I can try simplifying the code to be more concise and introducing a different strategy.\n\nOne idea is to use a fixed mu but with a different update logic that considers the ratio of residuals more directly. However, we must ensure the update remains C1-safe (summable step sizes). Let's try a balanced approach where we adjust rho based on the ratio of residuals, but with diminishing step sizes.\n\nHere's a modification that uses the ratio r_norm/s_norm to guide updates, but still uses tau for step sizes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe adaptive ADMM penalty update rule.\n\n    Conservative by design.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Adjust mu to decrease with iterations for finer convergence\n    # As k increases, mu approaches 1.0, making the condition stricter\n    # Start at mu and approach 1.0\n    adjusted_mu = 1.0 + (mu - 1.0) / (k + 1.0)\n    \n    # Summable step size (independent of residuals)\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n\n    # Protect against division by zero\n    # Use max with eps only when necessary\n    r_protected = max(r_norm, eps)\n    s_protected = max(s_norm, eps)\n    \n    # Direction logic ONLY (may depend on residuals)\n    if r_norm > adjusted_mu * s_protected:\n        new_rho = rho * (1.0 + t)\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > adjusted_mu * r_protected:\n        new_rho = rho / (1.0 + t)\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n\n    # Auxiliary scalar: purely tau_k (no residual dependence)\n    aux = t\n\n    return new_rho, aux, mode\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe adaptive ADMM penalty update rule.\n\n    Conservative by design with ratio-based adjustment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Summable step size (independent of residuals)\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    \n    # Compute the ratio of residuals\n    ratio = (r_norm + eps) / (s_norm + eps)\n    \n    # Update based on ratio thresholds\n    if ratio > mu:\n        # Primal residual is too large relative to dual\n        new_rho = rho * (1.0 + t)\n        mode = \"mul\"\n    elif ratio < 1.0 / mu:\n        # Dual residual is too large relative to primal\n        new_rho = rho / (1.0 + t)\n        mode = \"div\"\n    else:\n        # Balanced residuals\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n    \n    # Auxiliary scalar: purely tau_k (no residual dependence)\n    aux = t\n    \n    return new_rho, aux, mode\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change introduces several differences:\n1. Uses a fixed mu=2.0 instead of adaptive mu, which is simpler\n2. Uses the ratio of residuals directly, which is a different approach than comparing each residual to the other scaled by mu\n3. The thresholds are symmetric: if ratio > mu, increase rho; if ratio < 1/mu, decrease rho\n4. This approach is more balanced and might handle cases where both residuals are very small or very large differently\n5. The code is more concise (reduced from 44 lines to 36 lines in the function body)\n\nThis maintains the C1-safety because:\n- The step size t is still summable and independent of residuals\n- The update direction depends on residuals, which is allowed\n- The auxiliary scalar is still t\n\nThis approach is different from existing programs in the collection, which either use fixed mu with direct comparison or adaptive mu. By using ratio-based thresholds, we're exploring a different region of the feature space while keeping the update conservative.\n\nLet's also adjust the tau function to use different default parameters to add more diversity:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=1.0, p=1.2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Diminishing step size sequence.\n\n    Requirements:\n    - tau_k >= 0\n    - summable for p > 1\n    - depends only on k and fixed constants\n    \"\"\"\n    return c / ((k + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.8, p=1.1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Diminishing step size sequence.\n\n    Requirements:\n    - tau_k >= 0\n    - summable for p > 1\n    - depends only on k and fixed constants\n    \"\"\"\n    return c / ((k + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change uses smaller c and p values, which makes the step sizes diminish more slowly. This could lead to more aggressive updates early on while still being summable (p=1.1 > 1). This is a different parameter setting than what's seen in other programs.\n\nThese changes should:\n1. Maintain or potentially improve fitness by using a different update strategy\n2. Add diversity through:\n   - Ratio-based update logic\n   - Different tau parameters\n   - Fixed mu instead of adaptive\n3. Reduce code complexity and length\n\nThe fitness score might improve because the ratio-based approach could be more balanced in adjusting rho, and the slower diminishing step sizes might help convergence in certain cases."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
