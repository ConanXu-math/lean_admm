However, the system values diversity, so I should not make it identical to the top program.\n\nLet's focus on:\n1. Making updates start earlier (reduce K0)\n2. Adjust tau parameters to be more aggressive\n3. Remove the extra balancing condition which seems to add complexity without benefit\n4. Keep mu=2.0 (which is already there)\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=10):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.25, p=1.9, K0=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size with earlier start.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,  # Reduced from 3.0 to be more responsive\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Balanced ADMM update: more responsive than before but still stable.\n    Updates are triggered when one residual significantly dominates the other.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # More sensitive trigger: only require relative dominance\n    # But add a small absolute threshold to avoid updates when both are tiny\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps) and r_norm > 1e-8:\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n\n    if s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps) and s_norm > 1e-8:\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n\n    # Additional condition: if both residuals are large, adjust rho to potentially speed up convergence\n    # This adds diversity to the approach\n    if max(r_norm, s_norm) > 1e-4 and abs(r_norm - s_norm) < 0.5 * min(r_norm, s_norm):\n        # If r_norm is slightly larger, increase rho, else decrease\n        if r_norm > s_norm:\n            return rho * (1.0 + 0.5 * t), t, \"bal_mul\"\n        else:\n            return rho / (1.0 + 0.5 * t), t, \"bal_div\"\n\n    # If neither condition is met, keep rho unchanged\n    return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,  # Balanced responsiveness\n    c=0.25,\n    p=1.9,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Balanced ADMM update: responsive but stable with earlier updates.\n    Updates triggered when residuals are imbalanced by factor mu.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Trigger update when one residual dominates the other by factor mu\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    if s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n\n    return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes:\n1. Start updates earlier (K0=5 instead of 10)\n2. Use slightly different tau parameters (c=0.25, p=1.9) which are between the top performer and the current program\n3. Remove the absolute threshold (r_norm > 1e-8) which might block updates when residuals are small but imbalanced\n4. Remove the additional balancing condition which adds complexity and may not be beneficial\n5. Keep the function simpler and more focused, similar to the top performer but with different parameter values for diversity\n\nThis should make the program more responsive while maintaining stability, potentially improving the fitness score towards the level of the top performers. The diversity comes from using different tau parameters than the top program (c=0.25 vs 0.3, p=1.9 vs 1.8) while keeping the same structure."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
