Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.", "responses": ["Looking at the current program, I notice it's very similar to the top-performing programs, but with slight differences in parameters. The current program uses:\n- `scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.5)` and `adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.5 * scale)`\nThis gives up to 50% increase when ratio is large.\n\nHowever, the top performers (with fitness 0.0829) use:\n- `scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.4)` and `adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.4 * scale)`\nThis gives up to 56% increase when ratio is large.\n\nWait, 0.4 * 1.4 = 0.56, which is actually a 56% increase, not 40%. So the top performers have a different scaling approach. The current program's scaling might be too aggressive or not optimal.\n\nAlso, the current program's fitness is 0.0828, which is slightly lower than the top performers' 0.0829. So let's try to adjust parameters to match the top performers more closely.\n\nBut note: the system values diversity, so we shouldn't just copy exactly. However, since the fitness declined, we need to improve it. Let's try a balanced approach that's similar to the top performers but with a slight variation to maintain diversity.\n\nAnother observation: the top performers have a maximum scale of 1.4 and multiplier 0.4, while the current has 1.5 and 0.5. Let's try something in between or with a different characteristic.\n\nActually, looking at the diverse programs, they also have fitness 0.0828, so we need to find a better configuration. Let's try to make the adjustment more conservative by reducing the maximum adjustment, but in a smart way.\n\nAlso, note that the auxiliary scalar `aux` is set to `adjusted_t` in all cases. Perhaps we can include additional information to help convergence.\n\nWait, the top performers all converged in 12 iterations. The current program might be taking more iterations or not converging? But the fitness score is very close.\n\nLet's try to adjust the scaling to be more adaptive to the iteration number. Since `t` decreases with `k`, the adjustments become smaller over time. But perhaps we can make the scaling also depend on `k` to be more aggressive early and more conservative later.\n\nBut we must keep the function C1-safe, which means `tau` must be summable and independent of residuals. The adjustment to `t` can depend on residuals, which is allowed.\n\nLet's try a hybrid approach: use the top performer's scaling but with a slight modification that makes it unique and potentially better.\n\nHere's a plan:\n1. Keep the scale bound at 1.4 (like top performers)\n2. Adjust the multiplier to be 0.45 instead of 0.4 (slightly more aggressive)\n3. Also, make the scaling factor depend on `k` to reduce adjustments over time\n\nBut to maintain C1-safety, we can multiply by a factor that depends only on `k`.\n\nLet's implement:\n```python\n# Add a decay factor for the adjustment based on k\ndecay = 1.0 / (1.0 + 0.1 * k)  # This decreases with k\nscale = min(ratio / mu, 1.4)\nadjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.45 * scale * decay)\n```\n\nThis makes early iterations more responsive and later ones more stable, which could improve convergence.\n\nNow, let's write the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Adjust step size based on ratio, but keep it bounded\n    # Use a moderate scaling: min(ratio / mu, 1.5) to prevent excessive updates\n    scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.5)\n    adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.5 * scale)  # Increase t by up to 50% when ratio is large\n=======\n    # Adjust step size based on ratio, but keep it bounded\n    # Use a moderate scaling: min(ratio / mu, 1.4) to prevent excessive updates\n    # Add decay factor to reduce adjustments over iterations\n    scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.4)\n    decay = 1.0 / (1.0 + 0.1 * k)  # Decreases with k, depends only on k (C1-safe)\n    adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.45 * scale * decay)  # Increase t with decaying effect\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change:\n1. Reduces the maximum scale from 1.5 to 1.4 (like top performers)\n2. Uses a decay factor that makes adjustments smaller as iterations progress\n3. Uses a multiplier of 0.45 which is between the top performer's 0.4 and current 0.5\n\nThis should maintain diversity while potentially improving convergence by being more adaptive to iteration number.\n\nLet's also update the comment to reflect the change:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Auxiliary scalar: include information about adjustment\n    aux = adjusted_t\n=======\n    # Auxiliary scalar: include information about adjustment and decay\n    aux = adjusted_t\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis is a minor change to keep the comment accurate.\n\nThese changes should make the update rule more sophisticated while remaining C1-safe (since `decay` depends only on `k`). The adjustment to `t` now has a time-varying component which could help balance exploration and exploitation during the optimization.\n\nBy making early iterations more responsive to residual imbalances and later iterations more stable, we might achieve better convergence properties, potentially improving the fitness score."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
