The current program uses a dynamic threshold and adaptive scaling with sqrt(ratio), while the best program uses a simpler approach with adjusted step size based on max(r_norm/s_norm, s_norm/r_norm) and a fixed mu.\n\nKey differences:\n1. The best program uses a fixed mu=3.0, while current uses dynamic_mu that changes with k\n2. The best program adjusts step size by scaling tau based on ratio/mu, then uses the same adjusted_t for both mul and div cases\n3. The best program's aux returns adjusted_t, which includes residual information, while current returns just t\n\nThe current program's approach might be overcomplicating things, leading to slightly worse performance. Let's simplify towards the approach that worked best, but with some modifications to maintain diversity.\n\nHowever, note that the system values diversity across complexity and other features. So we should try to balance between improving fitness and maintaining a distinct approach.\n\nLet's try a hybrid approach:\n1. Keep the tau function as is (it's slightly different from the best program's tau)\n2. Use the best program's update logic but with a small twist to maintain diversity\n\nBut first, let's check the current program's code length exceeds 500 characters, which is noted as something to consider simplifying. The current program is indeed longer than the best program.\n\nLet's simplify by adopting the core logic from the best program while keeping our tau function and perhaps one unique element.\n\nHere's a plan:\n1. Replace the update_rho function with a simpler, more effective approach similar to the best program\n2. Keep our tau function to maintain some diversity\n3.

The update factor uses the same adjusted_t for both mul and div cases (consistent with best program)\n\nThis should improve fitness by adopting proven effective logic while keeping our unique tau function and slightly different scaling factor (0.3 instead of 0.5). This maintains diversity in the parameter space while likely improving performance.\n\nAlso, note that the code length is reduced, addressing the note about exceeding 500 characters."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
