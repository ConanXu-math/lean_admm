Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.", "responses": ["Looking at the current program, I notice it's performing well with a fitness score of 0.0828, but there's room for improvement. The current approach uses a ratio-based adjustment to the step size, which seems effective. However, I notice that the adjustment is always increasing the step size (by up to 50%) when the ratio is large, which might not always be optimal.\n\nLet's consider making the adjustment more balanced: sometimes we might want to decrease the step size when the ratio is very large to prevent overshooting. Also, the current approach uses a fixed scaling factor of 0.5, which might not be optimal.\n\nLet's try a different approach: make the adjustment symmetric and bounded, and also consider the iteration number to be more conservative as iterations progress.\n\nHere's a modified version that:\n1. Uses a more nuanced adjustment: when ratio is large, we might want to adjust the step size more carefully\n2. Makes the adjustment factor depend on both ratio and iteration number\n3. Ensures the adjustment can both increase and decrease the step size slightly\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Adjust step size based on ratio, but keep it bounded\n    # Use a moderate scaling: min(ratio / mu, 1.5) to prevent excessive updates\n    scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.5)\n    adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.5 * scale)  # Increase t by up to 50% when ratio is large\n=======\n    # Adjust step size based on ratio and iteration number\n    # Scale is bounded between -0.3 and 0.3 to prevent excessive changes\n    # As k increases, we become more conservative\n    bounded_ratio = min(ratio / mu, 2.0)\n    # The adjustment factor decreases with iterations\n    iteration_factor = 1.0 / (1.0 + 0.1 * k)\n    # Scale can be positive or negative based on whether ratio is above or below a threshold\n    if ratio > mu:\n        # If ratio is large, we might want to be more careful: reduce step size adjustment\n        scale = 0.3 * iteration_factor\n    else:\n        # If ratio is moderate, adjust based on how close it is to mu\n        scale = (bounded_ratio - 1.0) * 0.5 * iteration_factor\n    # Ensure scale is bounded\n    scale = max(min(scale, 0.3), -0.3)\n    adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + scale)  # Adjust t by up to \u00b130%\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change makes the adjustment more adaptive:\n1. When the ratio is large (greater than mu), we use a fixed positive adjustment but scaled down by iteration number\n2. When the ratio is moderate, the adjustment is proportional to (bounded_ratio - 1.0), which can be positive or negative\n3. The adjustment is always bounded between -30% and +30%, preventing extreme changes\n4. As iterations progress, the adjustment becomes smaller (due to iteration_factor), making updates more conservative over time\n\nThis should help in fine-tuning the step size more precisely, potentially leading to better convergence and thus a higher fitness score.\n\nAdditionally, let's adjust the auxiliary scalar to include more information:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Auxiliary scalar: include information about adjustment\n    aux = adjusted_t\n=======\n    # Auxiliary scalar: include adjustment information and ratio\n    aux = adjusted_t * (1.0 + 0.1 * ratio)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change makes the auxiliary scalar more informative by including the ratio, which might be useful for monitoring purposes.\n\nThese changes maintain the C1-safety because:\n1. The step size adjustment still depends only on k (through t) and residuals (through ratio)\n2. The adjustments are bounded\n3. The sum of t_k remains summable since we're just scaling by a bounded factor\n\nBy making the adjustment more nuanced and iteration-dependent, we might achieve better performance while maintaining diversity in the solution space."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
