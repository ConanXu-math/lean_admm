However, the fitness score has declined from 0.0829 to 0.0827, which suggests these parameters may be too aggressive. The top performers use more conservative scaling, which seems to work better.\n\nThe key insight is that the current program increases t by up to 96% (0.6 * 1.6) when ratio is large, while top performers only increase by up to 56% (0.4 * 1.4). This might be causing instability or slower convergence.\n\nLet's adjust the scaling parameters to be more in line with the successful programs, but with a slight twist to maintain diversity. We'll also consider simplifying the code to reduce its length (noted as exceeding 500 characters).\n\nFirst, let's check the current code length. The current program has about 600+ characters. We can make it more concise while preserving functionality.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n1.

Reduces the maximum scaling from 1.6 to 1.4 (matching top performers) and the multiplier from 0.6 to 0.45, which gives a maximum increase of 63% (0.45 * 1.4 = 0.63) vs 56% in top performers. This is slightly more aggressive but still conservative.\n2. Simplifies the code by removing redundant comments and combining factor calculation directly in the update.\n3. Makes the code more concise, which should help with the code length issue.\n4. Maintains diversity through the unique multiplier 0.45 (between 0.4 and 0.5).\n\nThis approach should improve fitness by moving closer to the successful parameters while keeping enough diversity to potentially find a better optimum."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
