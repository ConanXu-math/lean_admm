Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.", "responses": ["Looking at the current program, I notice it has a fitness score of 0.0766, which is lower than the top performers (0.0829). The current approach uses an \"excess\" ratio to scale the step size, which seems to be making updates too aggressive or not well-balanced. The top performers use a different strategy: they compute an imbalance ratio and adjust the step size based on that, but in a more moderate way.\n\nKey observations:\n1. The current program scales the update factor by `t * excess`, where `excess` is capped at 2.0. This might be too aggressive and could lead to instability.\n2. The top performers use a more balanced approach: they compute `ratio = max(r_norm/s_norm, s_norm/r_norm)`, then scale `t` by `(1.0 + constant * min(ratio/mu, bound))`.\n3. The auxiliary scalar in the current program is `t`, while in top performers it's `adjusted_t` which carries more information.\n\nLet's modify the current program to be closer to the best performing approach (Program 1 with score 0.0829), but with a slight variation to maintain diversity.\n\nSpecifically, I'll:\n1. Replace the excess-based scaling with the ratio-based scaling used in top performers.\n2. Adjust the constants to match those in Program 1 (scale bound 1.4, multiplier 0.4).\n3. Keep the auxiliary scalar as `adjusted_t` to match.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Direction logic ONLY (may depend on residuals)\n    # Compute how much the ratio exceeds the threshold\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        # Scale update by the excess ratio, but cap it\n        excess = min(r_norm / max(s_norm, eps) / mu, 2.0)\n        factor = 1.0 + t * excess\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        excess = min(s_norm / max(r_norm, eps) / mu, 2.0)\n        factor = 1.0 + t * excess\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n\n    # Auxiliary scalar: use t (simpler, like top performer)\n    aux = t\n=======\n    # Direction logic ONLY (may depend on residuals)\n    # Compute imbalance ratio (always >= 1)\n    if r_norm > eps and s_norm > eps:\n        ratio = max(r_norm / s_norm, s_norm / r_norm)\n    else:\n        ratio = 1.0\n    \n    # Adjust step size based on ratio, but keep it bounded\n    # Use a moderate scaling: min(ratio / mu, 1.4) to prevent excessive updates\n    scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.4)\n    adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.4 * scale)  # Increase t by up to 56% when ratio is large\n    \n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n\n    # Auxiliary scalar: include information about adjustment (C1-safe as it's based on t)\n    aux = adjusted_t\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change should bring the program closer to the best performing version while maintaining some diversity (the constants are exactly from Program 1). The approach is more balanced and should improve convergence, which likely contributes to the higher fitness score.\n\nAdditionally, the current program's docstring says \"Conservative by design,\" which aligns with the new approach since the scaling is bounded and moderate.\n\nLet's also update the docstring to reflect the new approach:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe adaptive ADMM penalty update rule.\n\n    Conservative by design.\n    \"\"\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe adaptive ADMM penalty update rule with balanced step adjustment.\n\n    Conservative by design: adjusts step size based on residual imbalance.\n    \"\"\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes should improve the fitness score by adopting a proven effective strategy while keeping the code concise and within the required character limits."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
