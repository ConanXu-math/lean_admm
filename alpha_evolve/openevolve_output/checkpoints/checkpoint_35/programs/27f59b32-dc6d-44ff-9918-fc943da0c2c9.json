The current approach uses a dynamic `effective_mu` that changes with iteration, and makes adjustments even when residuals are balanced. However, this might be too aggressive and could be causing instability.\n\nThe top performers have a simpler approach: they only make adjustments when one residual is significantly larger than the other (by a factor of `mu`), and when balanced, they sometimes make small adjustments based on the average residual magnitude. This seems more stable and effective.\n\nLet's analyze the current program:\n1. The `tau` function now allows updates even when `k < K0`, which might be too early and cause instability.\n2. The dynamic `effective_mu` decreases over time, making the condition easier to trigger later, which might not be ideal.\n3. The balanced adjustment always makes a change, which could lead to unnecessary oscillations.\n\nI'll suggest changes to align more closely with the top performers while keeping some unique elements for diversity.\n\nFirst, let's modify `tau` to be more standard like in the top programs, which only updates when `k >= K0` and returns 0 otherwise.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.3, p=1.0, K0=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        # Allow small updates even early on\n        return c / ((K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 2.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nNow, let's update `update_rho` to use a simpler approach similar to the top performers, but with a slight twist for diversity. We'll keep the balanced adjustment based on average residual magnitude, but remove the dynamic mu and the always-adjust behavior.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.3,\n    p=1.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Balanced ADMM update: combines responsiveness with stability.\n    Uses dynamic mu adjustment based on iteration.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Use ratio-based adjustment with dynamic mu\n    ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    # Adjust mu to be dynamic based on iteration\n    effective_mu = mu * (1.0 + 1.0 / (k + 1.0))\n    \n    if ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Increase rho when primal residual is larger\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif 1.0 / ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Decrease rho when dual residual is larger\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # Small adjustment based on which residual is larger\n        if r_norm > s_norm:\n            return rho * (1.0 + 0.5 * t), t, \"small_mul\"\n        elif s_norm > r_norm:\n            return rho / (1.0 + 0.5 * t), t, \"small_div\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Trigger update when one residual dominates the other by factor mu\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, make small adjustments based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        if avg_residual > 1.0:  # Large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/2), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.1:  # Small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/2), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes bring the program closer to the top performers, which have shown better fitness. The modifications:\n1. Restore `tau` to the standard implementation that prevents updates before `K0` to avoid early instability.\n2. Use a fixed `mu` instead of dynamic adjustment, which is simpler and more stable.\n3. Use the balanced adjustment strategy from the top programs, which only makes small adjustments when residuals are either very large or very small, and keeps `rho` unchanged otherwise.\n\nThis should improve fitness by making the update rule more stable and effective, similar to the best performers, while maintaining some diversity through the balanced adjustment logic."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
