The current program has several modifications that may be causing issues:\n\n1. It uses a dynamic mu that decreases with iterations: `dynamic_mu = mu / (1.0 + 0.1 * k)`\n2. It has additional logic for when residuals are balanced, making small adjustments\n3. This complexity might violate the \"C1-safe\" requirements or cause instability\n\nThe top-performing programs are simpler and more conservative. They:\n1. Use a fixed mu (or adjusted mu that approaches 1.0 from above)\n2. Only update when residuals are clearly imbalanced\n3. Don't make small adjustments when residuals are balanced\n\nLet's simplify the current program to be more like the top performers while maintaining some diversity. I'll focus on:\n1.

This should improve fitness by:\n1. Removing potentially unstable dynamic mu adjustments\n2. Eliminating the small adjustment logic which might violate C1-safety\n3. Making the function more conservative and reliable\n\nHowever, to add some diversity while maintaining good performance, I'll also adjust the tau function slightly.

This could help with faster convergence while still being summable (p=1.2 > 1).\n\nThese changes should bring the program closer to the top performers while maintaining some diversity through the choice of c=1.2. The simplified update_rho should improve fitness by removing complex logic that may have been causing issues, and the adjusted tau parameter provides a slight variation from other top programs."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
