The current program uses p=1.5 in update_rho, but top performers use p=2.0\n3. The thresholds for average residual adjustments are different: current uses >1.0 and <0.1, while top performers use thresholds around 0.5-0.7 for large and 0.03-0.06 for small\n\nThe top performers achieve better convergence with 12 iterations, and their parameters seem more balanced. Let's adjust the current program to be more similar to the successful approaches while maintaining some diversity.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=3):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates earlier for faster adaptation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=1.5,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Trigger updates for significant imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        if avg_residual > 1.0:  # Large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/2), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.1:  # Small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/2), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    Simpler trigger conditions for more responsive updates.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Simple trigger: respond to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        # Use thresholds that are different from top performers for diversity\n        if avg_residual > 0.68:  # Moderate to large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/2.8), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.035:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/2.8), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nReasoning:\n1. Changing K0 from 5 to 3 allows updates to start earlier, which seems to help convergence in top performers.\n2. Changing p back to 2.0 in update_rho (though tau uses p=2.0) to match the standard approach.\n3. Adjusting the average residual thresholds to be more in line with successful programs (0.68 and 0.035) while keeping them slightly different for diversity.\n4. Using a different adjustment factor (2.8) to maintain some uniqueness while likely improving performance.\n5. Adding documentation similar to top performers for consistency.\n\nThese changes should bring the program closer to the successful patterns observed in top performers while maintaining some diversity in the exact parameter values."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
