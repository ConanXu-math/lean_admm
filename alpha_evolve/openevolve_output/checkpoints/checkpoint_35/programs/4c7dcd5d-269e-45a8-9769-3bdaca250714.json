The current implementation uses a continuous adjustment based on a single ratio, which may not be as effective as the threshold-based approaches in the top-performing programs. Also, the auxiliary scalar includes `abs(np.log(ratio))`, which depends on residuals, potentially violating C1-safety requirements? Actually, the auxiliary scalar can depend on residuals, but the top programs tend to keep it independent or carefully bounded.\n\nLet's compare with the best program (Score: 0.0768), which uses:\n1. A dynamic threshold `dynamic_mu = mu * (1.0 + 2.0/(k + 1.0))` that adapts over iterations.\n2. Uses `log(ratio)` scaling with clipping.\n3. Keeps auxiliary scalar as `t` (independent of residuals).\n\nThe current program's approach is different, but it seems to be less effective. Let's try to incorporate elements from the best program while keeping some unique aspects to maintain diversity.\n\nKey changes to consider:\n1. Replace the continuous adjustment with threshold-based logic similar to the best program.\n2. Add dynamic threshold to be more responsive early.\n3. Keep auxiliary scalar independent of residuals (or at least bounded).\n4. Ensure the code is concise (current code length is noted as exceeding 500 characters? Actually, it's within limits, but we can simplify).\n\nLet's modify the `update_rho` function accordingly.\n\nFirst, let's update the `tau` function to match the best program's faster initial decay, which might help with convergence.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=1.0, p=1.2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Diminishing step size sequence.\n\n    Requirements:\n    - tau_k >= 0\n    - summable for p > 1\n    - depends only on k and fixed constants\n    \"\"\"\n    return c / ((k + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=1.0, p=1.2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Diminishing step size sequence with faster initial decay.\n\n    Requirements:\n    - tau_k >= 0\n    - summable for p > 1\n    - depends only on k and fixed constants\n    \"\"\"\n    # Add a small constant to denominator to prevent division by zero\n    # This gives faster decay initially\n    return c / ((k + 1.0 + 0.1 * np.sqrt(k + 1.0)) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nNow, let's update the `update_rho` function to use a dynamic threshold and threshold-based logic:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe adaptive ADMM penalty update rule.\n\n    Conservative by design.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Summable step size (independent of residuals)\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n\n    # Compute residual ratio with safeguards\n    ratio = (r_norm + eps) / (s_norm + eps)\n    \n    # Continuous adjustment based on ratio, bounded by mu\n    if ratio > mu:\n        # When primal residual is too large, increase rho\n        # Use a factor that depends on how much larger ratio is than mu\n        factor = 1.0 + t * min(ratio / mu - 1.0, 2.0)\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n    elif 1.0 / ratio > mu:\n        # When dual residual is too large, decrease rho\n        factor = 1.0 + t * min(1.0 / (ratio * mu) - 1.0, 2.0)\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n    \n    # Auxiliary scalar: include information about residual balance\n    aux = t * abs(np.log(ratio))\n\n    return new_rho, aux, mode\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe adaptive ADMM penalty update rule with dynamic threshold.\n\n    The threshold adapts over iterations to be more responsive early on.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Summable step size (independent of residuals)\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    \n    # Dynamic threshold that diminishes with iterations\n    # This makes the algorithm more sensitive early, and more stable later\n    dynamic_mu = mu * (1.0 + 2.0/(k + 1.0))\n    \n    # Direction logic with dynamic threshold\n    if r_norm > dynamic_mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        # More aggressive update when residuals are very imbalanced\n        # Use a larger step when the ratio is high\n        ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n        # Scale step size by log(ratio) but clip to avoid extreme values\n        scale = min(max(np.log(ratio), 0.1), 2.0)\n        new_rho = rho * (1.0 + t * scale)\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > dynamic_mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        ratio = s_norm / max(r_norm, eps)\n        scale = min(max(np.log(ratio), 0.1), 2.0)\n        new_rho = rho / (1.0 + t * scale)\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n\n    # Auxiliary scalar: purely tau_k (no residual dependence)\n    aux = t\n\n    return new_rho, aux, mode\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes should bring the program closer to the best-performing version while maintaining some diversity (the dynamic threshold and log scaling are from the best program, but we keep the same function signature and structure). The auxiliary scalar is now independent of residuals, which aligns with the C1-safety requirement.\n\nBy adopting the successful elements from the top program (0.0768), we aim to improve the fitness score back to that level or better. The dynamic threshold and faster-decaying tau might help with convergence, potentially reducing iterations or improving stability.\n\nNote: The current program's fitness declined, so reverting to a proven approach is a good strategy. However, to maintain diversity, we could also consider blending elements from other programs, but the best program's approach seems most promising.\n\nLet's see if these changes can improve the fitness score."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
