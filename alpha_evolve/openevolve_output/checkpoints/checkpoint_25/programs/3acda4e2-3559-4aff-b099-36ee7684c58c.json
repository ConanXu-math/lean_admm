The simpler approach seems to perform better.\n\nHowever, the current program also has a more complex `tau` function with a sqrt term, which might be unnecessary. The top programs use the standard `tau` function: `c / ((k + 1.0) ** p)`.\n\nLet's try to improve the fitness by simplifying the current program to be more like the top performers, but with some modifications to maintain diversity. Specifically, I'll:\n1. Revert `tau` to the standard form (which is simpler and might be more stable)\n2.

The `tau` function is simplified to the standard form, which matches the top performers and removes the sqrt term that might cause unnecessary complexity.\n2. The update logic now uses a fixed threshold `mu` (like the top programs) instead of a dynamic one, which seems to perform better.\n3. However, to maintain diversity, I changed the scaling of `adjusted_t` to use a different formula: `t * (1.0 + 0.3 * scale)` where `scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.5)`. This is different from the top programs which use `t * (1.0 + 0.5 * scale)` with `scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.5)`. This might explore a slightly different behavior.\n4. The auxiliary scalar now returns `adjusted_t` which includes information about the adjustment, which is consistent with the top programs.\n\nThis approach aims to combine the strengths of the top performers (fixed threshold, simpler tau) with a slight variation in the scaling factor to potentially find a better point in the feature space. The goal is to improve fitness while maintaining diversity."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
