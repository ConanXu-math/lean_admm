The top performers also have earlier updates (K0=3 vs K0=5) and different thresholds for balanced adjustments.\n\nThe current program's conservative approach might be slowing down adaptation, leading to slightly worse performance. Let's try to make it more responsive while maintaining some diversity in feature space.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Top performers use `mu=2.0` which is less conservative and responds more quickly to imbalances.\n2. They start updates earlier (K0=3 vs K0=5) which allows for faster adaptation.\n3. Their balanced adjustment thresholds are different (0.5/0.05 vs 1.0/0.05 in current program).\n4. The current program uses `p=1.5` in `tau` which makes the step size diminish slower than `p=2.0`.\n\nLet's adjust the current program to be more similar to the top performers while keeping some unique elements for diversity. Specifically, we'll:\n1. Change `mu` from 3.0 to 2.0 to be more responsive to imbalances.\n2. Change `K0` from 5 to 3 to start updates earlier.\n3. Adjust the balanced adjustment thresholds to be between the top performers and current program.\n4. Keep `p=1.5` in `tau` for diversity, but use `p=2.0` in `update_rho`'s default parameter.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=1.5, K0=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Only update when k >= K0 to ensure safety.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n\n\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Conservative yet adaptive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    Updates are triggered under significant imbalance, but also adjust\n    when residuals are both large or both small to aid convergence.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Conservative trigger: require significant imbalance\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, make small adjustments based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        if avg_residual > 1.0:  # Large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/3), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.05:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/3), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=1.5, K0=3):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates earlier for faster adaptation while maintaining safety.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n\n\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    More responsive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    Updates are triggered under moderate imbalance, and adjust\n    when residuals are both large or both small to aid convergence.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Less conservative trigger: respond to imbalances more quickly\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, make small adjustments based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        # Use thresholds that are between the top performer and current program\n        if avg_residual > 0.7:  # Moderate to large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/3), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.04:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/3), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExplanation:\n1. Changed `K0` from 5 to 3 to start updates earlier, which aligns with top performers and should help adaptation.\n2. Changed `mu` from 3.0 to 2.0 to be less conservative and respond more quickly to imbalances.\n3. Adjusted the balanced adjustment thresholds: \n   - For large residuals, changed from 1.0 to 0.7 (between top performer's 0.5 and current 1.0)\n   - For small residuals, changed from 0.05 to 0.04 (slightly more aggressive than top performer's 0.05)\n4. Kept `p=1.5` in `tau` for diversity, which makes step sizes diminish slower than `p=2.0`, potentially allowing more adjustments later in iterations.\n5. Updated docstrings to reflect the changes.\n\nThese changes should make the program more responsive like the top performers while maintaining some unique characteristics (different `p` in `tau` and slightly different thresholds) for diversity. This could improve the fitness score by making the adaptation faster and more effective, similar to the top performers which achieved 0.0829."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
