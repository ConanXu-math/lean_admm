The current program has several differences:\n1. `K0=10` in `tau` function, which delays updates until iteration 10, whereas top performers use `K0=3` for earlier updates.\n2. The update logic is more complex with additional conditions, which might be causing issues.\n3. The top performers have a simpler structure: they handle imbalances with `mu=2.0`, and when residuals are balanced, they adjust based on average residual magnitude with specific thresholds.\n\nThe current program's additional conditions (like checking if both residuals are large) might be interfering with convergence. Also, the delayed updates (K0=10) could be making the adaptation slower.\n\nLet's simplify and align more closely with the top-performing approaches while maintaining some diversity. I'll make the following changes:\n\n1. Change `K0` back to 3 to start updates earlier.\n2. Simplify the update logic to match the pattern of top performers: use the imbalance condition, then adjust based on average residual.\n3. However, to maintain diversity, I'll use slightly different thresholds than the top performers.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=10):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=3):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates earlier for faster adaptation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,  # Reduced from 3.0 to be more responsive\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Balanced ADMM update: more responsive than before but still stable.\n    Updates are triggered when one residual significantly dominates the other.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # More sensitive trigger: only require relative dominance\n    # But add a small absolute threshold to avoid updates when both are tiny\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps) and r_norm > 1e-8:\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n\n    if s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps) and s_norm > 1e-8:\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n\n    # Additional condition: if both residuals are large, adjust rho to potentially speed up convergence\n    # This adds diversity to the approach\n    if max(r_norm, s_norm) > 1e-4 and abs(r_norm - s_norm) < 0.5 * min(r_norm, s_norm):\n        # If r_norm is slightly larger, increase rho, else decrease\n        if r_norm > s_norm:\n            return rho * (1.0 + 0.5 * t), t, \"bal_mul\"\n        else:\n            return rho / (1.0 + 0.5 * t), t, \"bal_div\"\n\n    # If neither condition is met, keep rho unchanged\n    return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    Simpler trigger conditions for more responsive updates.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Simple trigger: respond to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        # Use thresholds that are different from top performers for diversity\n        if avg_residual > 0.7:  # Moderate to large residuals (different from 0.5, 0.6)\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/2.5), t, \"inc\"  # Different adjustment factor\n        elif avg_residual < 0.03:  # Very small residuals (different from 0.05, 0.04)\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/2.5), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1. Changing `K0` to 3 aligns with top performers, allowing earlier updates which likely helps convergence.\n2. Simplifying the update logic to follow the successful pattern: first handle imbalances with `mu=2.0`, then adjust based on average residual magnitude.\n3. To maintain diversity, I chose thresholds (0.7 and 0.03) and adjustment factor (t/2.5) that are different from the top performers (which use 0.5/0.05 with t/3 or 0.6/0.04 with t/3).\n4. This approach should improve fitness by being more aligned with proven strategies while still exploring a different point in the feature space.\n\nThese changes should make the program more effective while keeping it distinct from existing top performers, which is valuable for diversity."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
