Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.", "responses": ["Looking at the current program and its history, I notice that the top-performing program (Score: 0.0767) is actually simpler than the current one. The current program has added complexity with ratio-based adjustments, which may be causing slight performance degradation. The best program uses a straightforward update without adjusting the step size based on residual ratios.\n\nThe current program's fitness is 0.0766, while the best is 0.0767. Since the task is to improve fitness, and the best program is simpler, I should consider simplifying the current approach. However, the system values diversity, so I need to balance between improving fitness and maintaining different features.\n\nThe current program uses:\n1. A modified tau function with 1e-8 added to denominator\n2. Ratio-based factor adjustments\n3. aux = t * min(ratio, 3.0)\n\nThe best program uses:\n1. Standard tau without the 1e-8\n2. Simple factor = 1.0 + t\n3. aux = t\n\nLet's try to find a middle ground that might improve fitness while being different. Perhaps the issue is that the ratio-based adjustments are too aggressive or not well-tuned. Let's try a more conservative approach that still uses some ratio information but in a more controlled way.\n\nI notice that in the current program, when updating, it uses `min(ratio / mu, 2.0)` which can make the update step size vary. This might introduce instability. Let's try using a fixed step size adjustment but keep the ratio information in aux for diversity.\n\nHere's a plan:\n1. Keep tau as is (with 1e-8) for stability\n2. Use a fixed update factor (1.0 + t) like the best program, but only when residuals are imbalanced\n3. Adjust aux to include ratio information but in a bounded way\n\nWait, the best program doesn't use ratio at all. So to potentially improve fitness, I should move closer to the best program while keeping some diversity.\n\nLet's try:\n1. Remove the ratio-based factor adjustment\n2. Use simple factor = 1.0 + t\n3. Keep aux with some ratio information but in a way that might be beneficial\n\nActually, looking at the best program, its aux is just t, which is independent of residuals. The current program's aux depends on residuals, which might violate the requirement that aux should be independent of residuals? The problem says \"Auxiliary scalar: purely tau_k (no residual dependence)\" in the best program.\n\nSo to improve fitness, I should make aux independent of residuals. Let's implement:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Auxiliary scalar: now includes information about the update\n    aux = t * min(ratio, 3.0)\n=======\n    # Auxiliary scalar: independent of residuals for C1 safety\n    aux = t\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nBut wait, the current program also uses ratio in the factor calculation. Let's simplify that too:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Direction logic ONLY (may depend on residuals)\n    # Adjust t based on the degree of imbalance\n    ratio = max(r_norm / max(s_norm, eps), s_norm / max(r_norm, eps))\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        # More aggressive update when ratio is large\n        factor = 1.0 + t * min(ratio / mu, 2.0)\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        # Similarly for decreasing rho\n        factor = 1.0 + t * min(ratio / mu, 2.0)\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n=======\n    # Direction logic ONLY (may depend on residuals)\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        new_rho = rho * (1.0 + t)\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        new_rho = rho / (1.0 + t)\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nNow, this makes the current program very similar to the best program, except for the tau function. The best program's tau doesn't have the 1e-8 term. Let's also remove that to match:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=1.0, p=1.2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Diminishing step size sequence.\n\n    Requirements:\n    - tau_k >= 0\n    - summable for p > 1\n    - depends only on k and fixed constants\n    \"\"\"\n    # Add a small constant to prevent division by zero in early iterations\n    return c / ((k + 1.0) ** p + 1e-8)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=1.0, p=1.2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Diminishing step size sequence.\n\n    Requirements:\n    - tau_k >= 0\n    - summable for p > 1\n    - depends only on k and fixed constants\n    \"\"\"\n    return c / ((k + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis should bring the program very close to the best performing one, which has a fitness of 0.0767. Since the current fitness is 0.0766, this should improve it.\n\nHowever, to maintain some diversity, I could keep the mu parameter different. The best program uses mu=3.0, which is the same as the current program. So this change should yield similar performance.\n\nLet's summarize the changes:\n1. Simplify tau to remove the 1e-8 term (matches best program)\n2. Simplify update logic to use fixed factor (1.0 + t) instead of ratio-based adjustment\n3. Make aux independent of residuals (just t)\n\nThese changes should improve fitness by aligning with the best performing approach while keeping the code structure similar enough to be considered a valid evolution.\n\nNote: The system values diversity, but since we're improving fitness, it's acceptable to move towards a better solution. The changes still maintain the same function signatures and overall structure, which should be fine."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
