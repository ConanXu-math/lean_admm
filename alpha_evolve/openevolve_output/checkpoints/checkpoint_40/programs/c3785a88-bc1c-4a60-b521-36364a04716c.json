The current implementation has several complexities that may not be beneficial:\n\n1. The `tau` function uses `k + 2.0` instead of `k + 1.0`, which makes the step size decay faster than usual.\n2. The adaptive threshold `adaptive_mu` uses an exponential decay which might be too aggressive.\n3. The code uses `float('inf')` which could lead to numerical issues.\n4. The logic for computing `ratio` and `inv_ratio` is more complex than necessary.\n5. The auxiliary variable `aux` is set differently in each branch, which might not be consistent.\n\nLet's simplify and align with the best performing program (Program 1 with score 0.0828), which has a balanced approach with adjusted step size based on the residual ratio.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n1. Revert `tau` to the standard form used in the top performer.\n2. Remove the adaptive threshold and use a fixed `mu`.\n3. Simplify the ratio computation to match the top performer's approach.\n4.
