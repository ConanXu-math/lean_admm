However, there's room to explore different approaches that might improve the fitness score further or add diversity while maintaining high performance.\n\nThe current program uses a balanced adjustment strategy when residuals are balanced, with thresholds at 0.5 and 0.05. The top performers have similar structures but with slight variations in thresholds and adjustment factors. To potentially improve, we can try a more nuanced approach that considers the ratio of residuals even when they're balanced, or adjust the step size differently.\n\nOne idea is to use a smoother adjustment based on the residual ratio, which might help in fine-tuning rho more effectively. Also, we can adjust the tau function to be more responsive in early iterations.\n\nLet's make two changes:\n1. Modify tau to have a smaller K0 to start updates even earlier (K0=2 instead of 3)\n2. In the balanced case, adjust rho based on the ratio of residuals rather than just their average magnitude, which might be more precise.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=3):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates even earlier for faster adaptation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=2):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates even earlier for faster adaptation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        # Use slightly different thresholds than the top performer for diversity\n        if avg_residual > 0.5:  # Moderate to large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/3), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.05:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/3), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their ratio and magnitude\n        ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        \n        # If ratio is not too far from 1, make adjustments based on average residual\n        if 0.8 < ratio < 1.25:\n            if avg_residual > 0.6:  # Moderate to large residuals\n                return rho * (1.0 + t/4), t, \"inc\"\n            elif avg_residual < 0.03:  # Very small residuals\n                return rho / (1.0 + t/4), t, \"dec\"\n            else:\n                return rho, t, \"keep\"\n        else:\n            # If ratio is outside the balanced range but not enough to trigger main conditions,\n            # make a small adjustment towards balance\n            if ratio > 1.25:\n                return rho * (1.0 + t/6), t, \"adj_inc\"\n            else:\n                return rho / (1.0 + t/6), t, \"adj_dec\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1. Starting updates earlier (K0=2) might help the algorithm adapt more quickly in the initial iterations, potentially improving convergence speed.\n2. The new balanced adjustment strategy is more sophisticated: it first checks if the residuals are balanced in ratio (between 0.8 and 1.25). If they are, it uses average residual thresholds to adjust. If not, it makes smaller adjustments to bring them towards balance. This could lead to more precise rho updates, which might improve convergence and thus fitness.\n\nThis approach is different from the top performers, adding diversity while potentially maintaining or improving performance. The adjustment factors (t/4, t/6) are chosen to be conservative to avoid over-adjusting, which could destabilize convergence."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
