Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.", "responses": ["Looking at the current program, I notice it's very similar to the top performers, but with slightly different thresholds (0.7 and 0.08 vs 0.5/0.05 or 0.6/0.04). The fitness score is 0.0829, which matches the top performers, but we might be able to improve further by making the update strategy more responsive or balanced.\n\nHowever, the history shows that all top performers have the same fitness score (0.0829), suggesting we may be at a local optimum. To potentially improve, we need to explore different strategies while maintaining C1-safety.\n\nOne observation: the current program uses thresholds 0.7 and 0.08, which are more conservative than some other programs. This might cause it to miss opportunities to adjust rho when residuals are moderately large (between 0.5 and 0.7) or very small (between 0.05 and 0.08). Let's try to make it more responsive by using thresholds closer to the best performers, but with a twist for diversity.\n\nAlso, the adjustment factor is t/3 in all cases. We could vary this to see if different adjustment rates help.\n\nLet's try:\n1. Use thresholds 0.55 and 0.06 (between the top performers)\n2. Use different adjustment factors: t/2 for increasing and t/4 for decreasing (asymmetric)\n3. Add a small adjustment when residuals are very balanced but not extremely small\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Simple trigger: respond to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        # Use thresholds that are between the top performer and the current program\n        if avg_residual > 0.7:  # Moderate to large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/3), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.08:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/3), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\n    # Simple trigger: respond to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        # Use intermediate thresholds with asymmetric adjustments for diversity\n        if avg_residual > 0.55:  # Moderate to large residuals\n            # More aggressive increase\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/2), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.06:  # Very small residuals\n            # Less aggressive decrease\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/4), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            # For moderate residuals, make a very small adjustment towards balance\n            # If r_norm is slightly larger than s_norm, increase rho slightly, and vice versa\n            if r_norm > 1.1 * s_norm:\n                return rho * (1.0 + t/10), t, \"inc_small\"\n            elif s_norm > 1.1 * r_norm:\n                return rho / (1.0 + t/10), t, \"dec_small\"\n            else:\n                return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change introduces:\n1. More responsive thresholds (0.55 and 0.06) which are between the best performers\n2. Asymmetric adjustment rates: t/2 for increase (more aggressive) and t/4 for decrease (less aggressive)\n3. An additional layer for when residuals are balanced but not extremely small, adjusting based on their relative sizes with very small steps (t/10)\n\nThis approach maintains C1-safety because adjustments are still bounded by t, which diminishes to zero. The new adjustments are still within the C1-safe framework.\n\nThis strategy might help the algorithm converge faster or more reliably by making more nuanced adjustments, potentially improving the fitness score beyond 0.0829."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
