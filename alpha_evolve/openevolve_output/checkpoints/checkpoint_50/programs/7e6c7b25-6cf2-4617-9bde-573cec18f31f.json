The current program introduces several changes:\n1. A modified `tau` function with a more complex denominator: `(k + 1.0 + 0.1 * np.sqrt(k + 1.0)) ** p`\n2. A dynamic threshold `dynamic_mu` that changes with iterations\n3. Using `np.log(ratio)` to scale the step size, which may not be C1-safe\n\nThe top-performing programs use a simpler approach:\n1. A standard `tau` function: `c / ((k + 1.0) ** p)`\n2. A fixed threshold `mu`\n3. A bounded scaling based on the ratio of residuals\n\nThe current program's complexity might be causing issues. Let's simplify it to be more similar to the best-performing programs while keeping some unique features to maintain diversity.\n\nKey improvements:\n1. Revert `tau` to the simpler, proven formula\n2.

The simpler `tau` function is proven to work well in the top programs\n2. Using a fixed threshold `mu` instead of dynamic threshold simplifies the logic and aligns with successful approaches\n3. The scaling approach is similar to the top programs but with different parameters (1.6 and 0.6 instead of 1.4/1.5 and 0.4/0.5) to maintain diversity\n4. The auxiliary scalar is set to `adjusted_t` which is C1-safe because it only depends on `t` (which depends only on k) and `ratio` (which is bounded)\n5. This approach should improve fitness by being more similar to the top performers while keeping unique characteristics\n\nThis change should bring the fitness score closer to the top programs (0.0828-0.0829) while maintaining diversity through different scaling parameters."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
