The fitness score is 0.0767, which is good, but we can try to enhance it. The current update rule uses a fixed threshold `mu=3.0` and a diminishing step size `tau`. However, the auxiliary scalar `aux` is just `t`, which might not be optimal.\n\nLet's think about potential improvements:\n1. The current update rule is conservative, which is good for convergence, but perhaps we can make it more adaptive to improve convergence speed.\n2. The auxiliary scalar could be used to provide more information to the ADMM algorithm, which might help improve performance.\n3. We can adjust the parameters or add small variations to explore different behaviors while maintaining stability.\n\nSince the system values diversity, let's try modifying the update logic slightly to be more responsive while still being safe. One idea is to make the update factor depend on the ratio of residuals, but in a bounded way.\n\nHere's a modified approach:\n1. Instead of just using `1.0 + t` for multiplication/division, we can scale `t` by the residual ratio, but clip it to prevent extreme changes.\n2. Also, we can adjust the auxiliary scalar to include information about the residual balance.\n\nHowever, we must ensure the auxiliary scalar doesn't depend on residuals (as per the requirement in the comment). Wait, the comment says \"Auxiliary scalar: purely tau_k (no residual dependence)\", so we should keep `aux` independent of residuals.\n\nLet's focus on the update logic while keeping `aux = t`. We can adjust the update factor to be more aggressive when residuals are very imbalanced, but still bounded.\n\nHere's a modified version:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Direction logic ONLY (may depend on residuals)\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        new_rho = rho * (1.0 + t)\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        new_rho = rho / (1.0 + t)\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n=======\n    # Direction logic ONLY (may depend on residuals)\n    # Compute residual ratio with safeguards\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        # Scale t by the log of the ratio, but bounded\n        ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n        # Use a bounded factor: 1 + t * min(ratio, 5.0)\n        factor = 1.0 + t * min(ratio, 5.0)\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        ratio = s_norm / max(r_norm, eps)\n        factor = 1.0 + t * min(ratio, 5.0)\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change makes the update more responsive to the degree of imbalance between residuals, which could lead to faster convergence. However, we bound the scaling factor to prevent extreme updates that might destabilize the algorithm. The bound of 5.0 is chosen arbitrarily but seems reasonable.\n\nBut wait, this might violate the requirement that the update should be \"C1-safe\"? The original was conservative by design, and this is more aggressive. However, since `t` diminishes over time, the updates will become smaller, maintaining safety in the long run.\n\nLet's also consider adjusting the `tau` function slightly to have a different decay rate. Currently, `p=1.2` and `c=1.0`. We can try making it decay faster initially by adjusting parameters.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=1.0, p=1.2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Diminishing step size sequence.\n\n    Requirements:\n    - tau_k >= 0\n    - summable for p > 1\n    - depends only on k and fixed constants\n    \"\"\"\n    return c / ((k + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=1.5, p=1.3):\n    \"\"\"\n    Diminishing step size sequence.\n\n    Requirements:\n    - tau_k >= 0\n    - summable for p > 1\n    - depends only on k and fixed constants\n    \"\"\"\n    # Slightly faster initial decay with adjusted parameters\n    return c / ((k + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change increases `c` to 1.5 and `p` to 1.3, which makes `tau` larger initially but decay faster. This could help in early iterations while maintaining summability.\n\nThese changes introduce diversity in the feature space (complexity and behavior) while potentially improving fitness. Let's see if they help.\n\nHowever, note that the auxiliary scalar `aux` remains `t`, which is consistent with the requirement. Also, the update logic now uses residual ratios, which adds complexity but in a controlled manner.\n\nSince the system values diversity, these changes explore a different region of the feature space while maintaining the core structure of the algorithm."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
