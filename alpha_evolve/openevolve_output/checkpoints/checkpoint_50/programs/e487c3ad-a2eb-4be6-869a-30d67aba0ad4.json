The current implementation is more complex than the top performers, which are simpler and have higher scores. The top performers use a straightforward approach: when residuals are balanced (not triggering the main imbalance conditions), they adjust based only on the average residual magnitude with fixed thresholds.\n\nThe current program introduces an additional ratio check and makes adjustments based on both ratio and average residual, which may be overcomplicating things and leading to less effective updates. Also, the tau function starts updates at K0=2, which might be too early compared to K0=3 in top performers.\n\nLet's simplify the approach to align more closely with the successful patterns while maintaining some diversity. Specifically:\n1. Change K0 back to 3 to match top performers.\n2. Simplify the else branch to only use average residual thresholds, removing the ratio logic.\n3. Adjust thresholds to be between those used in top performers for diversity.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=2):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates even earlier for faster adaptation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=3):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates earlier for faster adaptation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their ratio and magnitude\n        ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        \n        # If ratio is not too far from 1, make adjustments based on average residual\n        if 0.8 < ratio < 1.25:\n            if avg_residual > 0.6:  # Moderate to large residuals\n                return rho * (1.0 + t/4), t, \"inc\"\n            elif avg_residual < 0.03:  # Very small residuals\n                return rho / (1.0 + t/4), t, \"dec\"\n            else:\n                return rho, t, \"keep\"\n        else:\n            # If ratio is outside the balanced range but not enough to trigger main conditions,\n            # make a small adjustment towards balance\n            if ratio > 1.25:\n                return rho * (1.0 + t/6), t, \"adj_inc\"\n            else:\n                return rho / (1.0 + t/6), t, \"adj_dec\"\n=======\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        # Use thresholds that are between top performers for diversity\n        if avg_residual > 0.65:  # Moderate to large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/3), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.04:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/3), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes should:\n1. Make the tau function consistent with top performers (K0=3), which has been shown to work well.\n2. Simplify the update logic in the balanced case to focus only on average residual magnitude, which is the pattern in all top performers.\n3. Use thresholds (0.65 and 0.04) that are between those used in Program 2 (0.65, 0.03) and Program D1 (0.7, 0.04) to maintain diversity while staying effective.\n4. Use adjustment factor t/3 which is common in several top performers.\n\nThis should improve fitness by making the algorithm more aligned with proven successful patterns while keeping some unique feature values for diversity."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
