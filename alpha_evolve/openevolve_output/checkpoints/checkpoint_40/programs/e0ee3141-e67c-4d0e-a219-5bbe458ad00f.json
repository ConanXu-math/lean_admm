Thresholds for balanced residuals: >1.0 and <0.1 (vs >0.5/0.6 and <0.05/0.04 in top performers)\n3. Adjustment factor: t/2 (vs t/3 or t/4 in top performers)\n\nThe top performers have earlier updates (K0=3) and more sensitive thresholds for moderate residuals. They also use smaller adjustment factors (t/3) which might lead to more stable convergence.\n\nLet's analyze the current program's approach:\n- It waits until iteration 5 to start updates, which might delay adaptation\n- The thresholds 1.0 and 0.1 are too extreme - residuals might rarely reach these values\n- The adjustment factor t/2 is larger than top performers' t/3, which could cause overshooting\n\nTo improve fitness, I'll make changes that bring the program closer to the successful patterns while maintaining some diversity:\n\n1. Change K0 from 5 to 3 to start updates earlier\n2. Adjust thresholds to be more sensitive: change 1.0 to 0.6 and 0.1 to 0.05\n3. Use t/3 instead of t/2 for more conservative adjustments\n4. Keep p=2.0 (same as top performers)\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=3):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates earlier for faster adaptation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with earlier and more frequent adjustments.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Less conservative trigger to respond more quickly to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, make small adjustments to encourage convergence\n        # If both residuals are large, increase rho; if both are small, decrease rho\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        if avg_residual > 1.0:  # Large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/2), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.1:  # Small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/2), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    Earlier updates and moderate thresholds for better convergence.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Respond to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        # Use thresholds similar to top performers but with slight variation\n        if avg_residual > 0.6:  # Moderate to large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/3), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.05:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/3), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes should improve the fitness by:\n1. Starting updates earlier (K0=3) to adapt more quickly\n2. Using more sensitive thresholds (0.6 and 0.05 vs 1.0 and 0.1) to trigger adjustments more appropriately\n3. Using t/3 instead of t/2 for more conservative adjustments when residuals are balanced\n4. The thresholds are slightly different from the exact top performers (0.6 vs 0.5) to maintain diversity\n\nThis approach combines elements from the successful programs while keeping some unique characteristics. The fitness should increase towards the 0.0829 range while maintaining diversity in the feature space."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
