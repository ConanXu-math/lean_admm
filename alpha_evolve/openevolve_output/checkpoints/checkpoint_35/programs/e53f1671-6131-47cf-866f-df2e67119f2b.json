The top performer (Program 1) has a different approach: it uses `K0=3` (earlier updates), different thresholds in the balanced case (0.5 and 0.05 vs 1.0 and 0.1), and smaller adjustment steps (t/3 vs t/2). It also has a slightly different structure in the balanced case with \"inc\" and \"dec\" actions.\n\nThe current program is very similar to Program 2 and Program 3, which have the same fitness. To improve, we should try to incorporate elements from the top performer while maintaining some diversity.\n\nKey differences in Program 1:\n1. `K0=3` instead of 5: starts updates earlier\n2. In the balanced case, thresholds are 0.5 and 0.05 (vs 1.0 and 0.1)\n3. Adjustment step is t/3 (vs t/2)\n4. The docstring mentions \"Start updates even earlier for faster adaptation\"\n\nLet's modify the current program to be closer to the top performer, but with a slight twist to maintain diversity. We'll change:\n- `K0` from 5 to 3\n- Adjust the thresholds in the balanced case to be between the top performer and the current program: use 0.7 and 0.08\n- Keep the adjustment step as t/3 to match the top performer's smaller steps\n- Also, update the docstring to reflect the changes\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=3):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates earlier for faster adaptation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with earlier and more frequent adjustments.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Less conservative trigger to respond more quickly to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, make small adjustments to encourage convergence\n        # If both residuals are large, increase rho; if both are small, decrease rho\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        if avg_residual > 1.0:  # Large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/2), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.1:  # Small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/2), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    Simpler trigger conditions for more responsive updates.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Simple trigger: respond to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        # Use thresholds that are between the top performer and the current program\n        if avg_residual > 0.7:  # Moderate to large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/3), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.08:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/3), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes should make the program more similar to the top performer while introducing slight variations in thresholds (0.7 and 0.08 vs 0.5 and 0.05) to maintain diversity. This could potentially improve the fitness score by adopting the earlier update strategy and more nuanced adjustments, while not being an exact copy."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
