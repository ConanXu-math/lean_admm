The differences seem to be in parameter choices and thresholds. Let's analyze:\n\n1. The current program uses K0=4, which delays updates compared to K0=3 in top performers.\n2. It uses mu=2.5, which is more conservative than mu=2.0 in top performers.\n3. The balanced adjustment thresholds are different: avg_residual > 0.8 vs > 0.6-0.7 in top performers, and < 0.02 vs < 0.04-0.05.\n4. The adjustment magnitude uses t/2 vs t/3 in top performers.\n\nThe top performers seem to be more responsive with earlier updates and more frequent adjustments. Let's try to make the current program more similar to the best performers while maintaining some diversity.\n\nHowever, since diversity is valuable, I'll try to find a middle ground that might perform better than the current version but not be identical to the top performers.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n1. Change K0 from 4 to 3 to start updates earlier.\n2. Change mu from 2.5 to 2.0 to be more responsive to imbalances.\n3. Adjust the balanced adjustment thresholds to be more moderate.\n4. Change adjustment magnitude from t/2 to t/3 to match top performers.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=4):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates earlier for faster adaptation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n\n\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.5,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    More responsive than before but still maintains some conservatism.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Trigger updates for significant imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        # Use thresholds that are different from top performer for diversity\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        if avg_residual > 0.8:  # Large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/2), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.02:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/2), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=3):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates earlier for faster adaptation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n\n\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    More responsive than before but still maintains some conservatism.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Trigger updates for significant imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        # Use thresholds that are between top performers for diversity\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        if avg_residual > 0.65:  # Moderate to large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/3), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.03:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/3), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change makes the program more similar to the top performers while keeping some diversity in the thresholds (0.65 and 0.03 instead of exactly matching any of them). The earlier updates (K0=3) and more responsive mu=2.0 should help improve convergence, and the adjustment magnitude t/3 matches the best performers.\n\nThe reasoning is that the current program's more conservative parameters might be causing slightly slower convergence, leading to the lower fitness score. By making it more responsive while maintaining unique threshold values, we might achieve better performance while preserving diversity in the feature space."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
