The current approach uses a dynamic `effective_mu` and ratio-based adjustments, which might be too complex and less effective than simpler strategies. The top performer uses a simpler trigger with fixed thresholds and starts updates earlier (K0=3). Also, the current `tau` function allows updates even when k < K0, which might be too aggressive.\n\nLet's analyze the top performer's key features:\n1. Starts updates earlier (K0=3 vs K0=5)\n2. Uses fixed mu=2.0 without dynamic adjustment\n3. In the balanced case, uses thresholds 0.5 and 0.05 for average residual\n4. Uses t/3 for adjustments in balanced cases (more conservative)\n\nThe current program has:\n1. K0=5, but allows updates even when k < K0 (which might not be C1-safe?)\n2. Dynamic effective_mu which changes with iteration\n3. Uses ratio-based triggers and small adjustments with 0.5*t\n\nTo improve fitness, I'll simplify the approach to be more similar to the top performer while keeping some diversity. Let's focus on:\n1. Making tau C1-safe by not updating when k < K0\n2. Using fixed mu without dynamic adjustment\n3. Using average residual thresholds that are between the top performer and others\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.3, p=1.0, K0=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        # Allow small updates even early on\n        return c / ((K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 2.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=3):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates even earlier for faster adaptation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.3,\n    p=1.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Balanced ADMM update: combines responsiveness with stability.\n    Uses dynamic mu adjustment based on iteration.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Use ratio-based adjustment with dynamic mu\n    ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    # Adjust mu to be dynamic based on iteration\n    effective_mu = mu * (1.0 + 1.0 / (k + 1.0))\n    \n    if ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Increase rho when primal residual is larger\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif 1.0 / ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Decrease rho when dual residual is larger\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # Small adjustment based on which residual is larger\n        if r_norm > s_norm:\n            return rho * (1.0 + 0.5 * t), t, \"small_mul\"\n        elif s_norm > r_norm:\n            return rho / (1.0 + 0.5 * t), t, \"small_div\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    Simpler trigger conditions for more responsive updates.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Simple trigger: respond to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        # Use thresholds that are between the top performer and others for diversity\n        if avg_residual > 0.75:  # Moderate to large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/2), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.075:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/2), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes:\n1. Make tau start updates earlier (K0=3) like the top performer, which helps with faster adaptation\n2. Use standard parameters c=0.2, p=2.0 which are common in high-performing programs\n3. Remove dynamic mu adjustment and use fixed mu=2.0 for simplicity and better performance\n4. Use average residual thresholds (0.75 and 0.075) that are different from the top performer (0.5 and 0.05) to maintain diversity while still being effective\n5. Use t/2 for adjustments in balanced cases, which is between the top performer's t/3 and other programs' t/2\n6. The update logic is now clearer and more similar to proven successful approaches\n\nThis should improve fitness by making the algorithm more responsive early on while maintaining stability through diminishing step sizes. The thresholds are chosen to be slightly different from the top performer to explore a different point in the feature space while still being effective."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
