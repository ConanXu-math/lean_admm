The current implementation has several issues that might be causing this:\n\n1. The `tau` function is modified to allow small updates even when `k < K0`, which might be too aggressive and violate C1-safety conditions.\n2. The dynamic adjustment of `mu` with iteration count (`effective_mu = mu * (1.0 + 1.0 / (k + 1.0))`) might be making the update conditions too complex and less effective.\n3. The thresholds for small adjustments (0.3*t) might not be optimal.\n\nLet's look at the top-performing program (Score: 0.0829) for inspiration:\n- It uses `K0=3` to start updates earlier\n- It has a simpler trigger condition without dynamic mu\n- It makes adjustments based on average residual magnitude with thresholds 0.5 and 0.05\n\nHowever, to maintain diversity, we should not copy it exactly. Let's create a balanced approach that:\n1. Uses a simpler trigger condition\n2. Maintains C1-safety by not updating when k < K0\n3. Uses reasonable thresholds for adjustments\n\nHere are my suggested changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=10):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Allow small updates even early on.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        # Small step size for early iterations\n        return c / ((K0 + 1.0) ** p) * 0.5\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Only update when k >= K0 to ensure safety.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Balanced C1-safe ADMM update with dynamic adjustments.\n    More responsive than extremely conservative approach.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Use ratio-based adjustment with dynamic mu\n    ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    # Adjust mu to be dynamic based on iteration\n    effective_mu = mu * (1.0 + 1.0 / (k + 1.0))\n    \n    if ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Increase rho when primal residual is larger\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif 1.0 / ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Decrease rho when dual residual is larger\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # Small adjustment based on which residual is larger\n        if r_norm > s_norm:\n            return rho * (1.0 + 0.3 * t), t, \"small_mul\"\n        elif s_norm > r_norm:\n            return rho / (1.0 + 0.3 * t), t, \"small_div\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.5,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    Simpler trigger conditions with moderate thresholds.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Simple trigger: respond to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        # Use moderate thresholds for diversity\n        if avg_residual > 0.8:  # Large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/2), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.08:  # Small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/2), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1. The `tau` function now properly returns 0.0 when `k < K0`, which is more standard for C1-safety. I chose `K0=5` as a middle ground between the top performer's 3 and the previous 10.\n\n2. The `update_rho` function is simplified:\n   - Removed the dynamic `mu` adjustment which was making the condition too complex\n   - Used a fixed `mu=2.5` (between 2.0 and 3.0 from other programs) for diversity\n   - Simplified the trigger conditions to match the pattern in top performers\n   - Added balanced adjustments based on average residual with thresholds 0.8 and 0.08, which are different from the top performer's 0.5 and 0.05\n   - This maintains diversity while likely improving performance\n\n3. The code is now shorter and more focused, which should help with the code length concern.\n\nThese changes should bring the program closer to the successful patterns seen in top performers while maintaining some unique features (different thresholds and mu value) for diversity."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
