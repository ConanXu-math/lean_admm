The `tau` function has been modified to include a square root term, which may violate the requirement that it depends only on k and fixed constants? Actually, it still depends only on k, but the form is different from previous successful versions.\n2. The dynamic threshold `dynamic_mu` changes with iterations, which might make the algorithm less stable.\n3. The use of `np.log(ratio)` and scaling factors adds complexity and may not be C1-safe (the auxiliary scalar `aux` is just `t`, which is good, but the update depends on residuals in a more complex way).\n\nThe top-performing programs (score ~0.0829) use a simpler approach:\n- A fixed `mu` threshold\n- A step size adjustment based on the ratio of residuals, but bounded\n- The auxiliary scalar is the adjusted step size\n\nThe current program is more complex and may be overfitting or introducing instability. Let's simplify it to be closer to the best performers while keeping some unique elements for diversity.\n\nHere are targeted changes:\n\n1. First, revert `tau` to the standard form used in top programs.\n2. Simplify the update logic to use a bounded adjustment based on residual ratio, similar to the best performers.\n3. Keep the dynamic threshold? Actually, the best programs don't use dynamic thresholds, so let's remove it.\n\nHowever, to maintain some diversity, we can keep a slightly different adjustment strategy.\n\nLet's make the following changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=1.0, p=1.2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Diminishing step size sequence with faster initial decay.\n\n    Requirements:\n    - tau_k >= 0\n    - summable for p > 1\n    - depends only on k and fixed constants\n    \"\"\"\n    # Add a small constant to denominator to prevent division by zero\n    # This gives faster decay initially\n    return c / ((k + 1.0 + 0.1 * np.sqrt(k + 1.0)) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=1.0, p=1.2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Diminishing step size sequence.\n\n    Requirements:\n    - tau_k >= 0\n    - summable for p > 1\n    - depends only on k and fixed constants\n    \"\"\"\n    return c / ((k + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe adaptive ADMM penalty update rule with dynamic threshold.\n\n    The threshold adapts over iterations to be more responsive early on.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Summable step size (independent of residuals)\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    \n    # Dynamic threshold that diminishes with iterations\n    # This makes the algorithm more sensitive early, and more stable later\n    dynamic_mu = mu * (1.0 + 2.0/(k + 1.0))\n    \n    # Direction logic with dynamic threshold\n    if r_norm > dynamic_mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        # More aggressive update when residuals are very imbalanced\n        # Use a larger step when the ratio is high\n        ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n        # Scale step size by log(ratio) but clip to avoid extreme values\n        scale = min(max(np.log(ratio), 0.1), 2.0)\n        new_rho = rho * (1.0 + t * scale)\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > dynamic_mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        ratio = s_norm / max(r_norm, eps)\n        scale = min(max(np.log(ratio), 0.1), 2.0)\n        new_rho = rho / (1.0 + t * scale)\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n\n    # Auxiliary scalar: purely tau_k (no residual dependence)\n    aux = t\n\n    return new_rho, aux, mode\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe adaptive ADMM penalty update rule with balanced adjustment.\n\n    Uses a bounded adjustment based on residual imbalance for stability.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Summable step size (independent of residuals)\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n    \n    # Compute imbalance ratio (always >= 1)\n    if r_norm > eps and s_norm > eps:\n        ratio = max(r_norm / s_norm, s_norm / r_norm)\n    else:\n        ratio = 1.0\n    \n    # Adjust step size based on ratio, but keep it bounded\n    # Use a moderate scaling: min(ratio / mu, 1.6) to prevent excessive updates\n    scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.6)\n    adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.4 * scale)  # Increase t by up to 64% when ratio is large\n    \n    # Direction logic with fixed threshold\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n\n    # Auxiliary scalar: include information about adjustment (C1-safe as it's based on t)\n    aux = adjusted_t\n\n    return new_rho, aux, mode\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExplanation:\n1. Reverted `tau` to the standard form used in top-performing programs, which is simpler and likely more reliable.\n2. Removed the dynamic threshold and complex log scaling, which may have introduced instability.\n3. Used a bounded adjustment strategy similar to the best programs, but with slightly different parameters (1.6 bound and 0.4 multiplier) to maintain diversity.\n4. The auxiliary scalar is now `adjusted_t`, which is C1-safe because it's derived from `t` (which only depends on k) and the ratio (which is bounded).\n5. This approach is closer to the best performers (score ~0.0829) while having unique parameters that might explore a different point in the feature space.\n\nThis should improve fitness by making the algorithm more stable and aligned with proven successful strategies, while maintaining some diversity through parameter choices."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
