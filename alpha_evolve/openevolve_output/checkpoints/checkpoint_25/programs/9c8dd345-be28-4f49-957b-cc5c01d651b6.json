The current approach uses a dynamic `effective_mu` that changes with iteration and always makes adjustments, even when residuals are balanced. This might be too aggressive and could destabilize convergence.\n\nThe top-performing programs are simpler and more conservative, only updating when there's a significant imbalance. They also have a clear separation between conditions. The current program's `tau` function also behaves differently by allowing updates even when `k < K0`, which might be too early.\n\nLet's analyze:\n1. The best program (score 0.0765) uses a balanced approach with additional adjustments based on average residual size.\n2. The current program's `tau` function returns a non-zero value when `k < K0`, which might be too aggressive.\n3. The dynamic `effective_mu` decreases over time, making the update condition easier to satisfy later, which might not be ideal.\n\nLet's simplify and align with the best-performing approach while adding some diversity. We'll:\n1. Make `tau` similar to the best program (no early updates)\n2. Use a balanced update strategy with clear conditions\n3. Keep some adjustments for balanced residuals but make them more conservative\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=10):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Allow small updates even early on.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        # Small step size for early iterations\n        return c / ((K0 + 1.0) ** p) * 0.5\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Balanced C1-safe ADMM update with dynamic adjustments.\n    More responsive than extremely conservative approach.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Use ratio-based adjustment with dynamic mu\n    ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    # Adjust mu to be dynamic based on iteration\n    effective_mu = mu * (1.0 + 1.0 / (k + 1.0))\n    \n    if ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Increase rho when primal residual is larger\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif 1.0 / ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Decrease rho when dual residual is larger\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # Small adjustment based on which residual is larger\n        if r_norm > s_norm:\n            return rho * (1.0 + 0.3 * t), t, \"small_mul\"\n        elif s_norm > r_norm:\n            return rho / (1.0 + 0.3 * t), t, \"small_div\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with earlier and more frequent adjustments.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Less conservative trigger to respond more quickly to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, make small adjustments to encourage convergence\n        # If both residuals are large, increase rho; if both are small, decrease rho\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        if avg_residual > 1.0:  # Large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/2), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.1:  # Small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/2), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nExplanation:\n1. Changed `tau` to match the best program (K0=5, no early updates) which is more standard and stable.\n2. Changed `mu` from 3.0 to 2.0 to be more responsive, aligning with the best program.\n3. Simplified the update logic to match the best program's approach, which has proven effective.\n4. The balanced adjustments are based on average residual size, which helps guide convergence when residuals are not imbalanced enough for major updates.\n5. This approach is similar to the top performer but with slight variations to maintain diversity.\n\nThis should improve fitness by adopting a proven strategy while keeping the code concise and focused. The changes make the program more aligned with the best-performing version while maintaining some unique elements (like the specific thresholds 1.0 and 0.1 in the balanced adjustments)."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
