The top program (Program 1) uses a more adaptive approach that makes adjustments even when residuals are balanced, by looking at their average magnitude. This seems to help improve convergence.\n\nThe current program is simpler and only updates when one residual dominates the other by a factor of mu. However, it may be missing opportunities to adjust rho when residuals are balanced but either too large or too small, which could help convergence.\n\nLet's analyze the differences:\n1. The top program uses additional logic in the else branch to adjust rho based on average residual magnitude.\n2. The current program has different default parameters (c=0.3, p=1.8 vs c=0.2, p=2.0 in the top program).\n\nTo improve fitness, I'll incorporate the adaptive adjustment from the top program while keeping some of the current program's characteristics to maintain diversity. Specifically, I'll add the balanced adjustment logic but with modified thresholds to be slightly different from the top program.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,  # Reduced from 3.0 to trigger updates more often\n    c=0.3,   # Increased from 0.2 for larger step adjustments\n    p=1.8,   # Reduced from 2.0 to make step size diminish slower\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Balanced ADMM update: more responsive than extremely conservative version.\n    Updates triggered when residuals are imbalanced by factor mu.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Trigger update when one residual dominates the other by factor mu\n    # Removed absolute condition since it's always true in practice\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    if s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n\n    return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,  # Reduced from 3.0 to trigger updates more often\n    c=0.3,   # Increased from 0.2 for larger step adjustments\n    p=1.8,   # Reduced from 2.0 to make step size diminish slower\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Balanced ADMM update: more responsive than extremely conservative version.\n    Updates triggered when residuals are imbalanced by factor mu.\n    Also includes adaptive adjustments when residuals are balanced.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Trigger update when one residual dominates the other by factor mu\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    if s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n\n    # When residuals are balanced, make small adjustments to encourage convergence\n    # If both residuals are large, increase rho; if both are small, decrease rho\n    # Use different thresholds than the top program to maintain diversity\n    avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n    if avg_residual > 0.5:  # Moderately large residuals (different threshold)\n        return rho * (1.0 + t/3), t, \"inc\"\n    elif avg_residual < 0.05:  # Very small residuals (different threshold)\n        return rho / (1.0 + t/3), t, \"dec\"\n    else:\n        return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nAdditionally, I notice that the tau function in the current program uses c=0.3 and p=1.8, which are different from the top program. To maintain diversity, I'll keep these parameters but adjust them slightly to be more effective with the new logic. However, since the fitness score might be sensitive to these values, I'll make a small adjustment to p to make the step size diminish a bit faster, which might help stability.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.3, p=1.8, K0=5):  # Adjusted defaults to match new parameters\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size with earlier start.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.3, p=1.9, K0=5):  # Slightly increased p for faster decay\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size with earlier start.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes aim to:\n1. Incorporate the adaptive adjustment from the top-performing program, which was shown to improve fitness.\n2. Maintain diversity by using different thresholds (0.5 and 0.05 vs 1.0 and 0.1) and adjustment magnitudes (t/3 vs t/2).\n3. Adjust the step size decay slightly (p=1.9 vs 1.8) to balance responsiveness and stability.\n\nBy adding the balanced adjustment logic, the program can now make finer adjustments when residuals are neither too imbalanced nor too balanced, potentially improving convergence speed and thus fitness score."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
