The current program has several modifications that seem to be hurting performance:\n1. Dynamic mu that decreases with iterations (mu / (1.0 + 0.1 * k))\n2. Additional small adjustments in the balanced case (small_mul/small_div)\n3. These changes likely violate the C1-safe conditions or make the updates too aggressive, leading to worse convergence.\n\nThe best programs (Program 1 and 2) use a fixed mu (or adjusted mu that approaches 1.0) and only update when residuals are significantly imbalanced. They also have a simpler auxiliary scalar (just t) and don't make small adjustments when balanced.\n\nThe current program is similar to Program D2, which also scored 0.0385. So to improve fitness, we should move towards the simpler, proven approach.\n\nLet's simplify the current program to match the structure of Program 1, which has the highest score and was formally certified (Lean4_Auto_Proven). Specifically:\n1. Remove dynamic mu and use adjusted_mu that approaches 1.0\n2. Remove small adjustments in the balanced case\n3.

The key improvements are:\n1. Uses adjusted_mu that approaches 1.0 as iterations increase, which is more theoretically sound than the current dynamic_mu that decreases indefinitely.\n2. Removes the small adjustments in the balanced case, which may violate C1-safe conditions.\n3. Uses protected residuals to avoid division by zero in a consistent way.\n4. Returns aux as just t, which is independent of residuals (important for formal certification).\n\nThis should improve the fitness score back to around 0.0769, matching the top performers while maintaining diversity through the adjusted_mu approach (which is slightly different from Program 2's fixed mu)."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
