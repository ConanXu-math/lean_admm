The current program introduces several modifications that may be too aggressive:\n1. A modified `tau` function with a sqrt term to accelerate initial decay\n2. A dynamic threshold `dynamic_mu` that changes with iteration k\n3. More aggressive scaling parameters (scale up to 2.0, weight decreasing with k)\n4. The auxiliary scalar tracks `dynamic_mu` instead of `adjusted_t`\n\nHowever, the top-performing programs (score ~0.0829) use simpler approaches:\n- Standard `tau` function without sqrt term\n- Fixed threshold `mu=3.0`\n- Moderate scaling (scale bounded to 1.4 or 1.5)\n- Auxiliary scalar tracks `adjusted_t`\n\nThe current program's complexity might be causing instability. Let's simplify it while keeping some adaptive elements that could be beneficial.

The standard `tau` function is used by all top performers and has proven effective. The sqrt term might be causing issues with summability or step size decay.\n2. Removing the dynamic threshold simplifies the logic. The fixed `mu=3.0` works well in other programs.\n3. The scaling parameters are adjusted to be more moderate:\n   - Scale bounded to 1.6 (between 1.4 and 1.5 from top performers, but slightly higher for diversity)\n   - Weight decreases with k (0.05 factor instead of 0.1) to gradually reduce adjustments, which might help convergence\n   - The multiplier 0.4 is similar to the best performer (0.4) rather than 0.5 or 0.3\n4. The auxiliary scalar now tracks `adjusted_t` which aligns with successful patterns.\n\nThis approach maintains some adaptive elements (weight decreasing with k) while staying closer to the proven structure of top performers. The changes should improve stability and potentially increase the fitness score back towards 0.0829 levels while offering a slightly different feature profile for diversity."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
