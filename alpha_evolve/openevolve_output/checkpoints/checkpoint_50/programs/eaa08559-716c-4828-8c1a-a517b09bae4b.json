Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.", "responses": ["Looking at the current program, I notice it's very similar to Program 3 in the top performers, which has a fitness of 0.0828. However, the top performers (Programs 1 and 2) have a slightly higher fitness of 0.0829. The key differences are in the scaling parameters: they use `min(ratio / mu, 1.4)` and `adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.4 * scale)` instead of `1.5` and `0.5`. This suggests that a more conservative adjustment might be beneficial.\n\nAlso, the current program has a comment about being \"Conservative by design,\" but the scaling is actually more aggressive (0.5 vs 0.4). Let's try to align with the better-performing parameters while also exploring a slight variation to maintain diversity.\n\nAnother observation: the top performers use `factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t` in both branches, which is the same as the current program. However, there might be an opportunity to adjust the threshold `mu` or the step size function `tau` to improve convergence.\n\nBut note: we cannot modify `tau` beyond its current implementation because the problem statement says only `update_rho` (and helpers) should be modified, but `tau` is a helper. However, the top performers don't change `tau`, so we should keep it as is.\n\nLet's try to make the following changes:\n1. Adjust the scaling parameters to match the better-performing ones (scale bound 1.4, multiplier 0.4)\n2. Also, consider adding a small adjustment based on iteration number to make the updates more adaptive over time\n\nHowever, to maintain diversity, we can try a slightly different approach: instead of using a fixed multiplier (0.4), we can make it decrease with iterations to be more conservative as convergence progresses.\n\nBut note: `t` already decreases with iterations, so adding another decreasing factor might overdo it. Let's look at the current program's fitness: 0.0828 vs 0.0829 is a small difference, so perhaps we can try a hybrid approach.\n\nLet's propose a change that uses the better parameters but also adds a small twist: adjust the scale bound based on iteration number to be more aggressive early and more conservative later.\n\nWait, but the top performers don't do this, and they have higher fitness. So maybe we should just copy their exact parameters? But that would reduce diversity.\n\nActually, the system values diversity, so we need to suggest changes that are different but potentially improve fitness. Let's try a balanced approach: use the better parameters (1.4 and 0.4) but also adjust the threshold `mu` slightly based on iteration to be more adaptive.\n\nHowever, we must ensure the changes are C1-safe (the step size must be summable). Adjusting `mu` doesn't affect summability because it's not in `tau`.\n\nLet's implement:\n1. Use scale bound 1.4 and multiplier 0.4 (like top performers)\n2. Slightly increase `mu` over iterations to make the condition stricter as we progress\n\nBut note: `mu` is a parameter with default value 3.0. We can adjust it based on `k`:\n   effective_mu = mu * (1.0 + 0.1 * np.log(k + 2))? But we can't use np.log without importing, and we want to avoid complex changes.\n\nAlternatively, we can make a simple adjustment: `effective_mu = mu * (1.0 + t)` where `t` is the step size, which decreases over time. This makes `mu` slightly larger early on and approaches `mu` as iterations increase.\n\nThis is a novel approach that might improve performance while maintaining diversity.\n\nLet's implement these changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Adjust step size based on ratio, but keep it bounded\n    # Use a moderate scaling: min(ratio / mu, 1.5) to prevent excessive updates\n    scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.5)\n    adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.5 * scale)  # Increase t by up to 50% when ratio is large\n    \n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        # Use adjusted step size for update\n        factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n=======\n    # Adjust step size based on ratio, but keep it bounded\n    # Use scaling parameters from top performers: min(ratio / mu, 1.4)\n    scale = min(ratio / mu, 1.4)\n    adjusted_t = t * (1.0 + 0.4 * scale)  # Increase t by up to 56% when ratio is large\n    \n    # Adjust mu slightly based on iteration to be more conservative over time\n    effective_mu = mu * (1.0 + t)  # t decreases with k, so effective_mu approaches mu\n    \n    if r_norm > effective_mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        # Use adjusted step size for update\n        factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t\n        new_rho = rho * factor\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > effective_mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        factor = 1.0 + adjusted_t\n        new_rho = rho / factor\n        mode = \"div\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change:\n1. Uses the scaling parameters from the top performers (1.4 and 0.4) which have shown better fitness.\n2. Introduces an adaptive `effective_mu` that starts slightly higher than `mu` and decreases towards `mu` as iterations increase (since `t` decreases). This makes the condition for updating `rho` stricter early on, which might prevent aggressive updates when residuals are not well-balanced, and becomes more permissive as convergence progresses.\n\nThis approach is different from the top performers (which use fixed `mu`), so it adds diversity while potentially improving fitness. The adjustment to `mu` is C1-safe because it only depends on `t` which is summable.\n\nLet's also update the comment to reflect the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe adaptive ADMM penalty update rule.\n\n    Conservative by design.\n    \"\"\"\n=======\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe adaptive ADMM penalty update rule with adaptive threshold.\n\n    Conservative by design with parameters from top performers and\n    iteration-dependent threshold adjustment.\n    \"\"\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes should improve the fitness score while maintaining diversity by introducing a novel adaptive threshold mechanism."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
