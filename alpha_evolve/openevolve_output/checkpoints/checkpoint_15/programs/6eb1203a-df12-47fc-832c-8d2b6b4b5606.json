The fitness score is 0.0691, which seems to be a combined score where lower might be better? But the system says \"improve its FITNESS SCORE\" which suggests higher is better. However, the top performing program has the same score, so we need to explore different approaches to potentially find better performance.\n\nThe current update triggers only under extreme conditions, which may cause slow convergence. Let's try to make it more adaptive while maintaining stability. We can adjust the conditions to be less strict, or add more nuanced behavior.\n\nAlso, the `tau` function returns 0 for k < K0, which means no updates happen in early iterations. This might be too conservative. Let's adjust K0 to allow earlier updates.\n\nLet's propose a few changes:\n\n1. Reduce K0 from 10 to 5 to allow earlier updates\n2. Adjust the update conditions to be less strict by reducing mu from 3.0 to 2.0\n3.
