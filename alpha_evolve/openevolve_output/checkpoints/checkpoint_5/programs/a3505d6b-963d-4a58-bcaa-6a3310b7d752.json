Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.", "responses": ["Looking at the history, the top-performing program (Score: 0.0769) is actually simpler than the current one. The current program has a fitness of 0.0385, which is lower. The simpler program uses a fixed step scaling (just `t`) without adaptive scaling based on residual ratios, and it's formally certified (Lean4_Auto_Proven), which might contribute to better fitness.\n\nThe current program adds complexity by scaling `t` with `ratio/mu`, which might be causing issues. Also, the condition `elif 1.0 / ratio > mu` is a bit indirect and could be replaced with a more direct comparison like `s_norm > mu * r_norm` as in the top program.\n\nMoreover, the top program is more conservative and follows the C1-safe requirement more strictly. The auxiliary scalar `aux` is just `t` in both, which is fine.\n\nLet's simplify the current program to match the top performer's logic, but keep some diversity by perhaps adjusting the condition slightly? However, to improve fitness, we should aim for the approach that scored highest.\n\nBut note: the system values diversity across complexity and other dimensions. Since the top program is already in the collection, we might want to create a variant that is slightly different but still simple. However, the goal is to improve fitness, so let's try to match the top program's logic exactly.\n\nWait, the current program is exactly the same as Program 2 (Score: 0.0385), which is not the top. So to improve, we should change it to be like Program 1.\n\nBut to maintain diversity, we can make a small adjustment: perhaps use a different `mu` value? However, the top program uses `mu=3.0` as default, which is the same as current. So let's just adopt the top program's update logic.\n\nLet's replace the `update_rho` function with the simpler version.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe adaptive ADMM penalty update rule.\n\n    Conservative by design.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Summable step size (independent of residuals)\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n\n    # Direction logic with adaptive step scaling based on residual ratio\n    # Compute the ratio, handling small values\n    ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    \n    if ratio > mu:\n        # Scale the step by how much the ratio exceeds mu, but cap it\n        scale = min(ratio / mu, 2.0)  # Cap at 2 to prevent too large steps\n        new_rho = rho * (1.0 + t * scale)\n        mode = \"mul\"\n    elif 1.0 / ratio > mu:\n        ratio_inv = s_norm / max(r_norm, eps)\n        scale = min(ratio_inv / mu, 2.0)\n        new_rho = rho / (1.0 + t * scale)\n        mode = \"div\"\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n\n    # Auxiliary scalar: purely tau_k (no residual dependence)\n    aux = t\n\n    return new_rho, aux, mode\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe adaptive ADMM penalty update rule.\n\n    Conservative by design.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Summable step size (independent of residuals)\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n\n    # Direction logic ONLY (may depend on residuals)\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        new_rho = rho * (1.0 + t)\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        new_rho = rho / (1.0 + t)\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n\n    # Auxiliary scalar: purely tau_k (no residual dependence)\n    aux = t\n\n    return new_rho, aux, mode\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change simplifies the logic to match the top-performing program, which should improve fitness. The simpler approach avoids adaptive scaling that might introduce instability and ensures the auxiliary scalar remains independent of residuals, which is important for C1-safety.\n\nBy making this change, we expect the fitness to increase towards 0.0769, and also potentially improve formal certification (Lean4_Auto_Proven). This is a targeted improvement that focuses on proven effectiveness."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
