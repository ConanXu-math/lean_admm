Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.", "responses": ["Looking at the current program, it has a fitness score of 0.0769, which is the highest among the top programs. However, the system values both fitness and diversity. The current program is quite simple and conservative, which seems to work well. But perhaps we can make targeted improvements to increase its fitness further while maintaining or even improving its simplicity.\n\nOne observation: the current program uses a fixed `mu=3.0` and a simple update rule. However, the `tau` function uses `k+1.0` in the denominator. Looking at the second program, it uses `k+2.0` which might help with faster initial decay, but that program scored lower. So that's not necessarily better.\n\nHowever, the current program's `aux` is always `t`, which is independent of residuals. Perhaps we can make `aux` more informative without breaking the C1-safety condition? But the requirements say auxiliary scalar should be purely tau_k (no residual dependence), so we should keep it as is.\n\nAnother idea: the update conditions use `max(s_norm, eps)` and `max(r_norm, eps)` to avoid division by zero. But perhaps we can adjust the threshold to be more balanced. Notice that when both residuals are very small, the condition might not trigger updates when they should. However, the current approach seems to work.\n\nLet's look at the fitness score: 0.0769 corresponds to 1/13 (since 0.076923... = 1/13). The second program has 0.0417 which is 1/24. So the current program converges in 13 iterations, which is better than 12? Wait, the second program has 12 iterations but a lower combined score? That seems contradictory. Actually, the combined score might be calculated differently.\n\nWait, the metrics for the current program show 'iters': 13 and combined_score: 0.0769, which is 1/13. So the combined score is likely 1/(number of iterations). So fewer iterations is better. The second program has 12 iterations, which should give 1/12 \u2248 0.0833, but it's 0.0417. So there must be another factor.\n\nLooking at the artifacts, the first program has 'eval_time': '20.735s' and the second has '24.987s'. So perhaps the combined score considers both iterations and time? Or perhaps there's a penalty for not being formally proven? The first program is Lean4_Auto_Proven, while the second is Lean4_Not_Auto_Proven.\n\nThus, to improve fitness, we should aim for:\n1. Fewer iterations\n2. Faster evaluation time\n3. Maintain formal provability\n\nThe current program is already formally proven, so we should keep changes that don't break that. Let's think about making the update more responsive to speed up convergence. Perhaps we can adjust the update step to be more aggressive when residuals are imbalanced, but still conservative enough to be C1-safe.\n\nNotice that the current update multiplies or divides by (1 + t), where t is small. This is very conservative. Perhaps we can make the update factor depend on the degree of imbalance, but that might break C1-safety. However, the requirements don't explicitly forbid it, but we need to be careful.\n\nActually, looking at the inspiration program, it uses more aggressive updates (2.0 * t) and additional adjustments, which might have caused it to not be formally proven. So we should avoid that.\n\nLet's try a simple modification: use a slightly larger base for the denominator in tau to make t decay faster? But that might slow down updates too much.\n\nWait, the current program uses `k+1.0`. What if we use `k+1.5`? That would make t slightly smaller, which might make updates more conservative and slow convergence. Not good.\n\nActually, to speed up convergence, we want updates to be larger initially, but still diminishing. So perhaps we can adjust p to be closer to 1? But p=1.2 is fixed.\n\nAnother idea: use a different mu value. The current mu=3.0 might be too conservative. Let's try mu=2.0 to trigger updates more often. This might help balance residuals faster and reduce iterations.\n\nBut we need to ensure this doesn't break formal verification. Since mu is a constant, changing it shouldn't affect the structure of the proof too much, but we can't be sure.\n\nLet's implement this change and see. Also, we'll keep everything else the same to maintain simplicity.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n1. Change mu from 3.0 to 2.0 in the function signature and in the conditions.\n2. Also, to avoid division by zero, we can use eps directly without max? But the current approach is fine.\n\nLet's write the diff:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=3.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe adaptive ADMM penalty update rule.\n\n    Conservative by design.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Summable step size (independent of residuals)\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n\n    # Direction logic ONLY (may depend on residuals)\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        new_rho = rho * (1.0 + t)\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        new_rho = rho / (1.0 + t)\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n\n    # Auxiliary scalar: purely tau_k (no residual dependence)\n    aux = t\n\n    return new_rho, aux, mode\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=1.0,\n    p=1.2,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe adaptive ADMM penalty update rule.\n\n    Conservative by design.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Summable step size (independent of residuals)\n    t = tau(k, c, p)\n\n    # Direction logic ONLY (may depend on residuals)\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        new_rho = rho * (1.0 + t)\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        new_rho = rho / (1.0 + t)\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n\n    # Auxiliary scalar: purely tau_k (no residual dependence)\n    aux = t\n\n    return new_rho, aux, mode\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change makes the condition more sensitive to imbalances, which should trigger updates more frequently and potentially lead to faster convergence. Since the update steps are still conservative (using t), it should remain C1-safe.\n\nAdditionally, to further improve, we might adjust the tau function slightly. But let's keep it simple for now. If we want to make another change, we can adjust the base in tau to k+1.0 to k+1.2? But that would make t smaller, which might not help.\n\nActually, to make updates larger initially, we can increase c slightly. Let's change c from 1.0 to 1.2. This will make t larger, leading to more significant updates early on, which might speed up convergence.\n\nHere's another change:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=1.0, p=1.2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Diminishing step size sequence.\n\n    Requirements:\n    - tau_k >= 0\n    - summable for p > 1\n    - depends only on k and fixed constants\n    \"\"\"\n    return c / ((k + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=1.2, p=1.2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Diminishing step size sequence.\n\n    Requirements:\n    - tau_k >= 0\n    - summable for p > 1\n    - depends only on k and fixed constants\n    \"\"\"\n    return c / ((k + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese two changes together should make the algorithm more responsive initially while maintaining the diminishing step size property. They are simple and shouldn't break formal verification since they only change constant parameters.\n\nLet's hope these improvements lead to fewer iterations and a better fitness score."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
