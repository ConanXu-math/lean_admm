The current program is similar to Program 3, which also scored 0.0691. \n\nKey observations:\n1. The top performer (Program 1) uses a different approach:\n   - It has a more dynamic `tau` function that allows small updates even early on (k < K0)\n   - It uses a ratio-based adjustment with a dynamic `effective_mu` that changes with iteration\n   - It always makes small adjustments when neither condition is met, based on which residual is larger\n   - Parameters: mu=2.0, c=0.3, p=1.0\n\n2. The current program has:\n   - A `tau` function that returns 0.0 for k < K0 (K0=10)\n   - Uses fixed mu=2.0 with absolute thresholds (1e-8 and 1e-4)\n   - Has an additional balancing condition when both residuals are large\n\nTo improve fitness, I should incorporate elements from the top performer while maintaining some diversity. The current program's balancing condition might be adding unnecessary complexity without improving performance.\n\nLet's focus on:\n1. Making the `tau` function more responsive early on\n2. Using a dynamic mu adjustment based on iteration\n3. Simplifying the conditions to be more like Program 1\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=10):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.3, p=1.0, K0=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        # Allow small updates even early on\n        return c / ((K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 2.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,  # Reduced from 3.0 to be more responsive\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Balanced ADMM update: more responsive than before but still stable.\n    Updates are triggered when one residual significantly dominates the other.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # More sensitive trigger: only require relative dominance\n    # But add a small absolute threshold to avoid updates when both are tiny\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps) and r_norm > 1e-8:\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n\n    if s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps) and s_norm > 1e-8:\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n\n    # Additional condition: if both residuals are large, adjust rho to potentially speed up convergence\n    # This adds diversity to the approach\n    if max(r_norm, s_norm) > 1e-4 and abs(r_norm - s_norm) < 0.5 * min(r_norm, s_norm):\n        # If r_norm is slightly larger, increase rho, else decrease\n        if r_norm > s_norm:\n            return rho * (1.0 + 0.5 * t), t, \"bal_mul\"\n        else:\n            return rho / (1.0 + 0.5 * t), t, \"bal_div\"\n\n    # If neither condition is met, keep rho unchanged\n    return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.3,\n    p=1.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Balanced ADMM update: combines responsiveness with stability.\n    Uses dynamic mu adjustment based on iteration.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Use ratio-based adjustment with dynamic mu\n    ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    # Adjust mu to be dynamic based on iteration\n    effective_mu = mu * (1.0 + 1.0 / (k + 1.0))\n    \n    if ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Increase rho when primal residual is larger\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif 1.0 / ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Decrease rho when dual residual is larger\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # Small adjustment based on which residual is larger\n        if r_norm > s_norm:\n            return rho * (1.0 + 0.5 * t), t, \"small_mul\"\n        elif s_norm > r_norm:\n            return rho / (1.0 + 0.5 * t), t, \"small_div\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes incorporate the successful elements from Program 1:\n1. The `tau` function now allows small updates early on (k < K0) and uses parameters that worked well (c=0.3, p=1.0, K0=5)\n2. The update logic uses a ratio-based approach with dynamic `effective_mu` that decreases over time, making adjustments more sensitive as iterations progress\n3. It always makes small adjustments when residuals are not extremely imbalanced, which seems to help convergence\n4. Removed the complex balancing condition that might have been causing issues\n\nThis should improve fitness while maintaining some diversity (different from Program 1 in minor ways, but similar in core approach). The parameters are set to match the best performer's successful configuration."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
