The main differences seem to be in the thresholds and adjustment strategies. The current program uses:\n1. K0=5 (later start for updates) vs K0=3 in top performers\n2. Thresholds for balanced residuals: avg_residual > 1.0 (too high) and < 0.1 (too high)\n   Top performers use thresholds around 0.5-0.7 for large residuals and 0.03-0.05 for small residuals\n3. Adjustment factor: t/2 vs t/2.5 or t/3 in top performers\n\nAlso, the current program's code length exceeds 500 characters, which might be affecting fitness. Let's simplify and align with successful strategies while maintaining some diversity.\n\nHere are targeted improvements:\n\n1. Change K0 to 3 to start updates earlier (like top performers)\n2. Adjust thresholds to be more effective: use 0.6 for large residuals and 0.04 for small residuals (between top performers)\n3. Use adjustment factor t/3 (like many top performers)\n4. Simplify docstrings to reduce code length\n\nLet's make these changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=3):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates earlier for faster adaptation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with earlier and more frequent adjustments.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Less conservative trigger to respond more quickly to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, make small adjustments to encourage convergence\n        # If both residuals are large, increase rho; if both are small, decrease rho\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        if avg_residual > 1.0:  # Large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/2), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.1:  # Small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/2), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Respond to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # Adjust based on residual magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        if avg_residual > 0.6:  # Moderate to large residuals\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/3), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.04:  # Very small residuals\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/3), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes should improve fitness by:\n1. Starting updates earlier (K0=3) which helps adaptation\n2. Using more appropriate thresholds (0.6 and 0.04) which are in line with successful programs\n3. Using t/3 adjustment factor which is common among top performers\n4. Reducing code length by simplifying docstrings\n\nThe thresholds 0.6 and 0.04 are chosen to be between the values used in top performers (Program 1 uses 0.7/0.03, Program 3 uses 0.5/0.05) to provide diversity while maintaining effectiveness. This approach balances between being too aggressive and too conservative."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
