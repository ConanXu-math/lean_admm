The `tau` function uses `p=1.0` and `K0=5`, which makes updates start later and with a slower diminishing rate compared to top performers (which use `p=2.0` and `K0=3`).\n2. The update logic is more complex with dynamic `effective_mu` and ratio-based adjustments, which might be less effective than the simpler approaches in top performers.\n3. The parameters are different: `c=0.3` vs `c=0.2` in top performers.\n4. The code is longer and more complex than necessary, which might be affecting performance.\n\nLet's simplify and align with the successful patterns from the top performers while maintaining some diversity. I'll focus on:\n- Using a simpler trigger condition similar to Program 1\n- Adjusting thresholds to be between the diverse programs for diversity\n- Keeping the `tau` function similar to top performers but with slight variation\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=1.0, K0=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        # Allow small updates even early on\n        return c / ((K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 2.0) ** p)\n=======\ndef tau(k, c=0.2, p=2.0, K0=3):\n    \"\"\"\n    C1-safe diminishing step size.\n    Start updates earlier for faster adaptation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < K0:\n        return 0.0\n    return c / ((k - K0 + 1.0) ** p)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.3,\n    p=1.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Intentionally conservative C1-safe ADMM update.\n\n    Slower than standard because updates are triggered\n    only under *extreme* residual imbalance.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Less conservative trigger: use ratio-based adjustment\n    ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    # Adjust mu to be dynamic based on iteration\n    effective_mu = mu * (1.0 + 1.0 / (k + 1.0))\n    \n    if ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Increase rho when primal residual is larger\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif 1.0 / ratio > effective_mu:\n        # Decrease rho when dual residual is larger\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # Small adjustment based on which residual is larger\n        if r_norm > s_norm:\n            return rho * (1.0 + 0.5 * t), t, \"small_mul\"\n        elif s_norm > r_norm:\n            return rho / (1.0 + 0.5 * t), t, \"small_div\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n=======\ndef update_rho(\n    rho,\n    k,\n    r_norm,\n    s_norm,\n    mu=2.0,\n    c=0.2,\n    p=2.0,\n    eps=1e-12,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive ADMM update with balanced adjustments.\n    Simpler trigger conditions for more responsive updates.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = tau(k, c=c, p=p)\n\n    # Simple trigger: respond to imbalances\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        return rho * (1.0 + t), t, \"mul\"\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        return rho / (1.0 + t), t, \"div\"\n    else:\n        # When residuals are balanced, adjust based on their magnitude\n        avg_residual = (r_norm + s_norm) / 2.0\n        # Use thresholds that are between diverse programs for diversity\n        if avg_residual > 0.65:  # Between 0.6 and 0.7\n            return rho * (1.0 + t/2.8), t, \"inc\"\n        elif avg_residual < 0.035:  # Between 0.03 and 0.04\n            return rho / (1.0 + t/2.8), t, \"dec\"\n        else:\n            return rho, t, \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes should:\n1. Make the `tau` function start updates earlier (K0=3 vs 5) and use p=2.0 for proper diminishing step size, matching top performers.\n2. Simplify the update logic to use the proven pattern from successful programs.\n3. Use thresholds that are between the diverse programs (0.65 and 0.035) to maintain diversity while likely improving performance.\n4. The adjustment factor t/2.8 is slightly different from others (which use 2.5, 3, etc.) for diversity.\n5. The code is now shorter and more aligned with the high-performing patterns.\n\nThis should help improve the fitness score back towards 0.0829 while maintaining some diversity in the feature space."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
