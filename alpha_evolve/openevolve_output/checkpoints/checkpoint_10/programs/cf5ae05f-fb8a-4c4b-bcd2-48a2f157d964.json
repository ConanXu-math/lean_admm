Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.\nBe thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.", "responses": ["Looking at the current program, I notice it has a fitness score of 0.0385, which is lower than the top-performing programs (0.0769). The current approach uses a scaling factor based on the residual ratio, which seems to be more aggressive. However, the top-performing programs use a simpler approach: they update rho by either multiplying or dividing by (1 + t) without scaling by the ratio, and they use a fixed mu without adjustment.\n\nThe current program's logic has a potential issue: when checking for the second condition, it uses `1.0 / ratio > mu`, which might not be exactly equivalent to `s_norm > mu * r_norm` due to floating point precision and the way ratio is computed. This could lead to different behavior compared to the top programs.\n\nAlso, the auxiliary scalar in the current program is just `t`, which matches the top programs. But the update logic is different.\n\nLet's simplify the current program to match the structure of the top-performing ones, which have proven to be more effective. Specifically, I'll change the update logic to be exactly like Program 2, which is the simplest and has the highest fitness.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Direction logic with adaptive step scaling based on residual ratio\n    # Compute the ratio, handling small values\n    ratio = r_norm / max(s_norm, eps)\n    \n    if ratio > mu:\n        # Scale the step by how much the ratio exceeds mu, but cap it\n        scale = min(ratio / mu, 2.0)  # Cap at 2 to prevent too large steps\n        new_rho = rho * (1.0 + t * scale)\n        mode = \"mul\"\n    elif 1.0 / ratio > mu:\n        ratio_inv = s_norm / max(r_norm, eps)\n        scale = min(ratio_inv / mu, 2.0)\n        new_rho = rho / (1.0 + t * scale)\n        mode = \"div\"\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n=======\n    # Direction logic ONLY (may depend on residuals)\n    if r_norm > mu * max(s_norm, eps):\n        new_rho = rho * (1.0 + t)\n        mode = \"mul\"\n\n    elif s_norm > mu * max(r_norm, eps):\n        new_rho = rho / (1.0 + t)\n        mode = \"div\"\n\n    else:\n        new_rho = rho\n        mode = \"keep\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change replaces the complex scaling logic with the simpler, proven approach from the top programs. It should improve the fitness score by making the update rule more conservative and consistent with the successful implementations.\n\nAdditionally, I notice that the current program's condition `1.0 / ratio > mu` might not be exactly equivalent to `s_norm > mu * r_norm` when `r_norm` is very small. The new condition directly compares `s_norm` with `mu * r_norm`, which is more straightforward and matches the top programs.\n\nThis change should bring the fitness score closer to 0.0769, as it aligns with the best-performing implementations while maintaining the same auxiliary scalar and tau function."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
